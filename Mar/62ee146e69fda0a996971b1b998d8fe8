WorldStage NewsOnline—-The Federal Government has been advised to appoint  an economically vibrant technocrat as Minister of Finance so as to transform the nation’s economy. An industrialist, Mr Imo Anasonye disclosed this in an interview on Tuesday in Aba. Anasonye, also the Director-General, National Association of Small Scale Industrialists (NASSI), Abia chapter, said: “We need an up to date, dynamic Minister of Finance. “Somebody that is well abreast of the Nigeria’s economic situation and somebody that has within his or her reach, the solution to what is happening in Nigeria’s economic sphere now. “We need a vibrant Finance Minister, somebody that understands the economic game and plays it well to turn around the economic fortunes of this nation, because if we don’t get that, we are sunk. “We need someone who knows about pure economic planning because Nigeria cannot continue relying only on oil revenue which is dwindling by the day. “We need to shore up the capacities of the real sector without further delay in a strategic manner.“ Anasonye said that the nation’s economy was having hiccups and needed proper economic planning to boost the real sector, the backbone of great economies. He stressed that with a good economist grounded in economic planning, the real sector would be revived for the benefit of all Nigerians as the nation would depend less on oil. The industrialist expressed concern that SMEs, which contributed much to the economy, were rarely captured in national and state budgets and cautioned that continuing in that direction would ruin Nigeria’s economy further. Anasonye said that the only way to grow the economy fast in a big way was for governments to invest in SMEs through SME institutions like NASSI, Chambers of Commerce, among others.
