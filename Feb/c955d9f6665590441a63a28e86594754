The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Lagos, Mr Jimi Agbaje, has promised to provide access to modern mass transportation modes if elected in the March 2 election. Agbaje in a statement issued in Lagos on Sunday decried the transportation difficulties being experienced by residents in the state, assuring his government would provide a succour, if elected. Agbaje said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) had failed to provide the needed infrastructure and support systems to facilitate the easy movement of people through the metropolis. “I am appalled whenever I see the state of transportation in the state. The current transportation system, as we currently have it today, has failed to address the needs of the over 20 million inhabitants of the state. “Every day, Lagosians struggle to move from one point to the other because of the lack of basic infrastructure that would facilitate seamless movement,” he said. He pointed to the poor state of the roads, as well as the failure to guarantee a supportive environment for private sector participation in the transportation sector. “Traversing the nooks and crannies of the state, one is greeted with the sight of the dilapidated state of public roads infrastructure. “This has unduly increased the travel time of residents. Added to this is the fact that successive regimes have failed to consider the need to open up more frontiers for public transportation. “For example, the people of Ikorodu have in the last 20 years been promised the elusive Fourth Mainland Bridge that has never come on board and has remained a pipe dream,” he said. Agbaje, expressed sympathy with those living along the Mile 2-Okokomaiko corridor who, he claimed, had daily harrowing traffic experience from the non-completion of the Apapa-Badagry highway.
