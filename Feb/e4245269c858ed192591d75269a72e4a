A mild drama unfolded in Bokkos Local Government Area of Plateau on Sunday when the Collation Officer, Prof. Musa Izam of University of Jos, attempted to escape declaring results for Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly (NASS) elections in the area.The  Professor of Physics was in the midst of results collation when he took excuse from party agents, INEC officials and observers to go an ease himself.Mr Michael Abi, the Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bokkos Local Government Area, told NAN that little did they know collation of results from the 12 wards of the council had been concluded waiting to be announced when the professor excused himself.“We however smelt a rat and asked some people to monitor him. And true to our fears and suspicion, the man ran into a waiting vehicle nearby and zoomed off.“In fact, we had to chase after them as the vehicle sped towards Barikin Ladi Local Government Area en route to Jos and caught up with them around Maikatako near Kuba village in Bokkos.“Guess who took him away in that car, one of the Special Assistants to Gov. Simon Lalong on Security Matters, whose name I won’t want to mention in the press.“We brought them back to the collation centre only for the professor of physics to start apologising to everybody in the hall over his actions,’’ Abi narrated.Mr Jonathan Mawuyau, former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, also apologised on behalf of the don, asking that he should be allowed to continue with compilation of the results for final announcement of winners of the elections in the area.“We could not believe our eyes when we saw such a strange attitude from a learned and a whole Professor of Physics who works with a reputable institution like the University of Jos,’’ Rep. Solomon Maren lamented over the development.“In fact, it is like a film that we use to watch. Well, the good thing is that he is back and I think we are ready to conclude the compilation and for the result to be announced to us.“Nevertheless, all eyes were on the collation officer for him to do the needful without springing another surprise on the results collation and announcement of winner of polls,’’ Maren said.
