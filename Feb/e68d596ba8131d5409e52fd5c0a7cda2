WorldStage NewsOnline— The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) on Friday confirmed closure of  the sale of Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) forms for 2019. The board’s Head of Media, Dr Fabian Benjamin who disclosed this in an interview in Abuja said the sales ended on Thursday. Benjamin, however said that online registration was still ongoing. Benjamin said: ” This is because some people earlier bought e-pins for the exams but were unable to register before now, so we are monitoring them online and would avail them the opportunity to register. ” Therefore, we cannot give the exact figure of the registered candidates for now until this is over. ” He added that the registration would continue until the board decides. The board had commenced the sale and online registration of the 2019 to 2020 UTME forms on Jan. 10 and was scheduled to end on Feb. 21.
