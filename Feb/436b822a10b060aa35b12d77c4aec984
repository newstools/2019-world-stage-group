The Police Command in Enugu State has warned individuals and groups to desist from discouraging Nigerians, especially the residents of Enugu State, from voting in the forthcoming general elections. The Presidential/National Assembly and the Governorship/State Assembly elections will be holding on Feb. 16 and March 2. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP. Ebere Amaraizu, gave the warning in a statement issued on Wednesday in Enugu. Amaraizu said that the command’s attention had been drawn to activities of mischief makers bent on inflicting fear in the minds of citizens with the aim of to discouraging them from coming out to exercising their franchise on the election day. He alleged that the mischief makers posted bills and posters, warning members of the public not to come out to vote. The PPRO said the command would not sit and watch these mischief makers go about causing fear in the minds of citizens under any guise. “Security operatives have been directed to fish out those in this habit in order to bring them to book. “Members of the public are once more advised to go about their normal lawful businesses and to feel free to visit any of their polling stations, booths and cast their votes as security has been provided.
