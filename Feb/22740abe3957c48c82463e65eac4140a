WorldStage Newsonline– Following several attacks on its staff while on duty, Ikeja Electric (IE) has threatened to discontinue service to hostile customers and communities in the state. The company’s Spokesman, Mr Felix Ofulue, gave the warning following rising spate of assaults on some of its field staff. “While we understand that issues surrounding electricity services can be emotive, we maintain that wanton attacks on our staff are completely irrational, unnecessary and unproductive. “Ikeja Electric has provided multiple channels through which our customers can lodge formal complaints with respect to our service or bills. “Where responses from these channels are deemed unsatisfactory, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has also set up a robust Forum Office for the redress of customer complaints. “We have escalated the recent attacks, which went viral, to the appropriate authorities and we are currently exploring every legal channel available to us to ensure the offenders are brought to book. “Ikeja Electric will not allow its personnel to suffer intimidation, assaults and other bodily harm or threat from anyone who hides under various smokescreen for the unwarranted attack of its staff,’’ Ofulue said in a statement condemning the attacks. The IE spokesman said that it would continue to deliberate with stakeholders in flashpoint areas to find ways to amicably resolve all pertinent issues of concern to its customers and communities. According to him, this is in the interest of the safety of its employees and members of the public. “However, where these attacks persist, Ikeja Electric, will as a matter of course, continue to escalate such matters to law enforcement agencies. “We will promptly withdraw our services from communities and customers that prove too hostile to operate in.
