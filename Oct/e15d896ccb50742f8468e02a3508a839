Commission (NCC) in collaboration with all stakeholders has set in motion
mechanisms for compliance with the National Identity Management Commission
(NIMC) established under the NIMC 2007 Act which released the National
Identification Number Regulations 2017 that a person must provide his/her
National Identity Number (NIN) in order to register a telephone SIM card. Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice
Chairman/CEO, NCC in his remark at the third annual conference of the Guild of
Corporate Online Publishers on October 4, 2019 in Lagos, said the commission
engaged in continuous verification exercise of the SIM data collected by the
MNOs and their SIM registration agents across the country to deliver on its
mandate as part of the its consistent regulatory interventions to ensure credible
subscriber data. Represented by Mr Omoniyi Ibietan, Head, Online Media and Special Publication, he said “I, therefore, would like to use this opportunity to encourage Nigerians – you and I – who want to acquire new SIM cards, for one reason or the other, to ensure that they obtain a National Identity Number first.” He assured Nigerians that the NCC will remain
consistent in its commitment to using telecoms to support the current
tripartite agenda of the Federal Government to improve the economy, enhance
security of lives and property and to fight corruption in our society.
