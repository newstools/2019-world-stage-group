As Nigerians prepare for the resheduled general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned politicians  to be wary of social media posts after voting prior to the official declaration of result by the commission. The INEC  Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Kebbi state state, Alhaji Ahmad Mahmud, gave the advice during an interactive session with stakeholders in Birnin Kebbi on Monday. “Fake news is now a trend and can mar our efforts to ensure free, fair and credible elections. “We urge you to be wary of social media posted results before official declaration. “Only INEC Returning Officers at wards, local governments and state levels have the statutory authority and power to declare the results,” he said.
