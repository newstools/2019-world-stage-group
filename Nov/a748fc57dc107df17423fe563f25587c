WorldStage NewsOnline—- No fewer than 66 motorists have been arrested for driver’s licence violation in the ongoing “Operation Show Your Driver’s Licence” in Lagos state. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos State Sector Command commenced the operation on Monday as part of its Ember months programmes to enhance road safety and reduce road accidents. The Sector Commander, Mr Hyginus Omeje, who disclosed this on Thursday said 43 drivers were arrested on the first day while 23 drivers were apprehended on the second day. The corps commander said that the command had commenced compiling arrest made on the third day of the exercise. Omeje said that road accidents would continue to increase as long as unqualified drivers used the road. The sector commander also said that the corps arrested 30 motorists for Number Plate Violation within the period. He said that the exercise would continue to weed out people that were not certified to drive on the road. The FRSC boss said: “The problem is that, some of these people we have behind the wheels are not even licensed. “Anybody that is not license to drive should not be on the road. Some have expired licences, some having licences that they applied for but are not picking them. “We have over 60, 000 driver’s licences at the various licensing centres in the state that are not collected. “Now, that we have come up with operation show your driver’s licence, it is either you have your driver’s licence or we pick you up. “We have option of prosecuting you or issue you with a ticket and pay the fine.” According to him, the fine is N10,000. “Meanwhile, you require only N6,’350 to renew your driver’s licence for three years. “So, if you have to pay a fine of N10, 000, that will be penny wise, pound foolish.” Omeje, who frowned at the attitude of driving without a valid licence, reiterated that it was the only legal document that permitted anyone to drive on Nigerian roads.
