of things to position the country as a net producer of technology, rather than
a dumping ground. He said since
the concept of the Fourth Industrial Revolution also known as Globalisation 4.0
was first introduced by the World Economic Forum at its Annual Meeting in 2016,
the awareness on how businesses and nations can tap into the phenomenal has
been spreading. “The fear that Nigeria is about to miss out of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, the advent of “cyber-physical systems” involving
entirely new capabilities for people and machines, may not be entirely unfounded
going by the level of awareness across every sector of the economy,” he said. “WorldStage Economic Summit 2019 will draw attention to the
areas that require urgent attentions by relevant public and private bodies
regarding adoption of fourth Industrial Revolution as a major player. “For Nigeria to be at the
driver sit of technology, WES 2019 will create opportunity for the policy
makers and the private sector to identify their roles in the new scheme of
things for the country to be positioned as a net producer of technology, rather
than a dumping ground.”
