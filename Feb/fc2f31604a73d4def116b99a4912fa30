The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God,  Pastor Enoch Adeboye has appreciated God for keeping the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo and others alive in an helicopter crash  on Saturday in Kabba, Kogi State. Adeboye in  a live telecast from the RCCG headquarters, Lagos asked the congregation to rise and give glory to God for saving the life of his son, the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, from a crash. According to Adeboye, the devil wanted to take the life of Yemi Osinbajo, but God put the devil to shame. He, therefore, asked the congregation to specially appreciate God on behalf of the Vice President and all the crew onboard, for his supernatural protection, saying Nigeria would not mourn. In his sermon, entitled: “Carriers of Glory”, Adeboye said for anybody to carry glory, he must be a true child of God and live a life of holiness. Taking his lesson from the Bible in the book of Matthew 5 : 14- 15, he said: “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. “As a carrier of glory, anywhere you arrive the darkness will automatically disappear. “When God begins to use you, the glory belongs to God and you, so you must learn to always give glory to God. “Do not take the glory to yourself because it is not yours, it belongs to God,” Adeboye said.
