WorldStage Newsonline– President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his 67th birthday, slated to hold on Friday, and commended him for making life better for many Nigerians. President Buhari, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Wednesday, described Tinubu as one of the strong pillars of Nigeria’s democracy. The president joined the APC family in celebrating the Asiwaju of Lagos, who is also the Jagaban of Borgu Kingdom in Niger State, for his selflessness in serving his country. President Buhari recalled some of the sacrifices of the party chieftain to include standing up against injustice in 1993 when the June 12 elections were annulled, which led to his going on political exile for many years, and a protracted legal battle with the Federal Government when funds for Lagos were withheld. He affirmed that “Asiwaju’s uncompromising posture in the face of injustice and refusal to follow the path of least resistance for personal gains stand him out today as a rare breed and one of the cornerstones of Nigeria’s democracy, especially with his track record of persistence, consistency and effective leadership.’’ The President, who also described Tinubu as the father of modern Lagos State,  commended the visionary and inclusive leadership style that the Asiwaju provided for the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria for eight years. He noted that Tinubu played an important role in laying the foundation for a modern and technologically driven city, and ensuring that “every successive leader in the state sticks with the masterplan of a greater Lagos.’’ President Buhari, therefore, rejoiced with family members, friends, political and business associates of the Jagaban on this auspicious milestone, which he said was further brightened with the many successes recorded at the recently concluded polls by his strong leadership. According to the president, the best years of the APC National Leader are still ahead, praying that the almighty God will grant him longer life, good health and more wisdom to keep serving the country he loves so much.
