The National Pension Commission (PenCom) is set to attract 60 million Nigerians in the Informal Sector to tbe pension scheme. PenCom said this was in order to ensure all Nigerians live a good life at old age. Head, Research and Corporate Strategy of the commission, Dr Aminu Farouk told the NAN on Saturday in Lagos that the set of Nigerians would be attracted through micro pension scheme. Farouk said the scheme, which targeted Nigerians with low and irregular income in the informal sector  would be formally launched before the first quarter ends. Farouk said the scheme was expected to enhance the growth of pension assets to the tune of N3 trillion by year 2024. He said, ” I have no idea how many people are expected to be registered at the launch of the Micro Pension. ” I also don’t think PenCom has any number presently. “However, we intend to cover the entire informal sector over time, this is about 60 million citizens,” he said. He said that the commission and tbe Pension Fund Admistrators (PFAs) were working on the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure for a seamless operation of the plan. He also said that micro pension would capture self-employed Nigerians, those with irregular income usually in the informal sector and the financially uninformed with limited access to pension plan.
