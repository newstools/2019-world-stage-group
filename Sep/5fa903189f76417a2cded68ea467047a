The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has pledged to assist Delta to train officers and men of its traffic management agency free of charge. The FRSC Corps Marshal, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, made the pledge on Monday in his address at the inauguration of the FRSC’s new office complex in Asaba. He said that the officers of the corps were committed to the actualisation of best practices in road safety management and administration in the country. The corps marshal also said that the FRSC would continue to support states that have traffic management agencies in ensuring professionalism in road safety administration. “We appreciate the support of the Delta Government to the FRSC and that is why we will continue to work together. “When we needed land to build this new office complex, the Delta government gave us this piece of land and today, the complex is ready. “As a mark of our appreciation, I want to pledge our assistance to help train officers of the Delta traffic management agency at no cost to the state government. “It is my belief that training and retraining of road traffic workers will help improve their capacities to carry out their jobs more efficiently,” Oyeyemi said. The FRSC boss lauded the Delta Government for its support to the FRSC, saying conducive accommodation was key to better service delivery. He said: “Upon inception of office, my focus has been on infrastructural development. “This is because when we have good accommodation, our work will be easier to perform. “There is, no doubt, that this new edifice we have here in Asaba will help improve our productivity.” Also speaking, the Chairman of the FRSC Governing Board, Malam Bukhari Bello, said that the Federal Government was committed to addressing the accommodation challenges facing the corps. He noted that a conducive working environment would go a long way in helping the FRSC carry out its operational and administrative works more efficiently.
