Nasarawa state chapter of the Public Complaints Commission (PCC) said it treated 2,639 complaints out of the 3, 071 complaints it received between 2018 to date in the state. Philip Iyakwari, Commissioner in-charge of the commission in the state, made this known in an interview on Saturday in Lafia. According to the commissioner, 432 cases registered against the federal and state agencies as well as local governments are still pending as at July this year. He said that 12 area offices have been created to bring administration of justice closer to the rural populace across the 13 local government areas of the state. The commissioner said that complaint boxes would soon be introduced in major towns and villages across the state. “I want to make it categorically clear that all the services rendered by the commission are free of charge to both the complainants and the respondents,“ he said. He advised aggrieved persons not to resort to unlawful means of obtaining justice, but to channel their complaints to the commission for appropriate investigation and redress. Iyakwari, who expressed concern over the absence of office accommodation, transportation for the commission in the state, said the commission was faced with threat of ejection from its landlord  due to non-payment of rent. The commissioner appealed to the state and federal governments to assist the commission with office accommodation. The commissioner said that the contractor handling the construction of its office at the permanent site had abandoned the project after receiving N20 million out of the contract sum of N50million.
