The acting D-G of CMD said that every decision to take one line of action or another must benefit from robust decision making processes. He said that the three days training would provide for participants from various MDAs opponunity to strengthen their skills and update their knowledge that would influence their contribution to the nation. He said that such skill would help them in development of Council Documents, especially Memoranda for the Ministers to be presented at the Federal Executive Council.
