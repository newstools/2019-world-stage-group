WorldStage Newsonline– The Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi has condemned the Federal Government’s borrowing plan for infrastructure financing, arguing that the amount spent on infrastructure did not correspond with the level of borrowing. Obi, who voiced the condemnation in interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today, a political programme on Channels Television, said the issue in campaign was about millions of unemployed Nigerians who didn’t know where the next meal would come from. He also discarded claims that the campaign routine of his party was counterproductive, alleging that those sponsoring such claims were out to divert the attention of the party from achieving its aim. He said: “The issue in this campaign is about millions of unemployment campaign. We have millions of Nigerians who don’t know where the next meal will come from.” Citing the ongoing ASUU strike, which has grounded academic activities in universities, Obi submitted that adequate attention was not being paid to critical issues in the country. The former Anambra State government expressed confident that when elected, an administration led by him and Atiku will be able to turn around the Nigerian civil service considered bloated and inefficient by many. “You can make it work; you can make it to be productive,” he said of the civil service. “There is nothing about being overbloated. Yes, there might be issues but you can make it work. You can decide to make every worker, every employee to be productive.”
