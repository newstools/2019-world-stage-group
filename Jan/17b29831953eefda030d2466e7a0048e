The Presidential Candidate, Young Progressives Congress (YPP), Prof.
Kingsley Moghalu says the forthcoming election would be a choice between the past and the future.
Moghalu speaking with newsmen on Thursday in Abuja said the future of the country does
not lie in the hands of either the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) nor the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Moghalu said he has offered himself to work for the realisation of a
brighter future for the country.
“I offer myself once again as a path for Nigeria renaissance, as the
path to Nigeria resurgence, as the emancipation of the Nigerian masses
and in that context the 2019 election is an emancipation struggle.
“It is more than just an election; it is a choice between freedom and
slavery in the hands of our recycled politicians.
“My vision for the country rests on a tripod, to heal Nigeria and build
a nation; to break the backbone of poverty and to lead Nigeria to
economic transformation and thirdly, to restore Nigeria’s standing in
the world. That is what we are going to do,’’ he said.
Moghalu said for any leader to be able to rescue the country
and lay solid foundation, such person must be very educated, have a
philosophical world view, and a practical capacity for policy
formation and implementation.
“So it is not enough that you have been a politician for many years.
It doesn’t make you a leader. ‘’
Moghalu, pledged that if elected his administration would
implement the new N30, minimum wage for workers.
He said that his administration would end reoccuring Academic Staff Union of
Universities (ASUU) strikes.
Moghalu said that his administration would engage in partial privatisation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and total removal of subsidy to fight corruption.
