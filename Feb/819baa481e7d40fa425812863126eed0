President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed disappointment over security reports linking people close to some of the members of Zamfara State Council of Traditional Rulers with banditry in the state. Malam Garba Shehu, the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, in a statement, said Buhari made his feelings known at a meeting with the royal fathers at the Government House, Gusau, on Sunday. The President, who was in Zamfara as part of his ongoing nationwide presidential campaign tour of the country, charged the traditional rulers to do more in curbing banditry and kidnapping in their communities. He expressed the determination of his administration to defend the country from criminals and insurgents. “We are determined to defend the nation and its people. We are disappointed with some of the things going on. “You are responsible for the security of your neighbourhood. Being close to your people, you know them. You are still relevant. I am sorry this has extended to some of your families,” he said. While referring to the deployment of a large number of security personnel to the state, President Buhari said that security is also the business of the traditional rulers, not that of the police and other security agencies alone. “More security is not good news, but we must do something to secure our environment,” he noted. The President commended the gallantry of the security agencies in battling kidnapping and banditry, saying “you know what we have achieved. You had one who styled himself as Buharin Daji, the Buhari of the forests, claiming to be in charge and not I at the centre. He is no more, and by my surviving him, you now know who is stronger.”
