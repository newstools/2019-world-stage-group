The European Union (EU) New Trade Commissioner, Irishman Hogan said on Monday that he would seek a reset of EU/U.S. trade relations on a number of contentious issues when he meets his U.S. counterpart for the first time next month. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum in mid-2018. It has done the same to 7.5 billion dollars worth of EU products over a dispute about subsidies for European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), and is threatening action against France over a digital services tax. Hogan, who was promoted from the role of EU farm chief this month, spoke to U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer just before Christmas, he said. “We agreed to meet in Washington in mid-January to discuss the long list of issues causing strain in the relationship between the EU and the U.S. There is no point in getting into the details of resolving trade irritants unless we agree a line on a common trade agenda,” he was quoted as saying. “I will be seeking a reset of the EU/U.S. trade relationship on issues like tariffs on steel and aluminum and the threat of U.S. tariffs in response to a digital tax in Europe.” The two sides are in theory trying to forge a deal to remove overall import duties, but are stuck over farm products, which Washington says must be included and Brussels says cannot feature. They are also at odds over Washington’s paralysis of the World Trade Organisation’s judicial arm, a vital part of the global trading system.
