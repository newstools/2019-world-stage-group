President Muhammadu Buhari has submitted a proposal for a new National Minimum Wage of N27,000 to the National Assembly. The proposal came in the National Minimum Wage Act (Amendment) Bill submitted by the President to the federal legislature.
Buhari’s letter accompanying the bill was read by Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Thursday.
When signed into law, the Bill will replace the current national wage of N18,000 earned monthly by the least paid worker in the country.
This development is coming barely two days after the National Council of State approved N27,000 as the new wage for state civil servants.
Buhari said in the letter that the Bill and “amendments therein were arrived at after consultations by the tripartite committee on the National Minimum Wage”.
“The committee was constituted by me in November, 2017 to consider, make recommendations and advise the government on this issue.
“The tripartite committee comprised of representatives of the Federal Government, Nigeria Governors’ Forum, organised private sector and the organised federations of trade unions in Nigeria.
“The Federal Executive Council, the National Economic Council and the National Council of State have all noted and approved these recommended amendments,” he said.
In the Bill, according to Buhari, organisations employing less than 25 persons are exempted from paying the proposed new wage.
It also proposes a five-year review period for the Act in line with the constitutional review period for pensions.
