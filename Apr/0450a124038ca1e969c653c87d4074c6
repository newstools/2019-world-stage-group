National telecommunications operator, Globacom, has launched
a special telephone package  for members
of the Alaba International Amalgamated Traders Association, Lagos. Known as Alaba SME SIM, the package enables the traders to
call each other free of charge after subscribing to a monthly plan that would
also offer them 1GB bonus data. Globacom’s Head, Enterprise Sales, Mr. Eric Uwaoma, said at
the launch of the SIM recently that the company would provide the members of
the association an electronic ecosystem to connect with their vendors, clients
and families. This, he noted, would help the traders to showcase their products
and services on-line, increase their profit margin and reduce  congestion at the market. New executive members of the association were also
inaugurated at the event. The team which will lead the 16 associations under
the aegis of Alaba International Amalgamated Traders Association is led by the
President, Chief Nathaniel Anigbogu. Mr Uwaoma congratulated the executives and wished them a
successful tenure,  adding that their
partnership with Globacom will lead to a new era of prosperity and relevance as
the company had the capacity to offer various solutions with its nationwide,
super fast 4G LTE backed by Glo 1 submarine cable. Welcoming guests earlier, the President of the Association,
Chief Nathaniel Anigbogu promised to run an all inclusive government describing
the partnership with Globacom as a welcome development that would assist the
Association to create more jobs for its members. He called on government at the federal, state and local
government levels to assist the market with the provision of good roads,
electricity, clinics, fire service and security.
