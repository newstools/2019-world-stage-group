The Nigerian government financial system operates a structure where funds flow to the three systems of government from what is termed the FEDERATION ACCOUNT. The Federation Account serves as the central pocket through which the Governments – Federal, States, and Local Governments – fund developmental projects as well as maintain their respective workforce. The flow of revenue into the Federation Account includes oil revenues and related taxes, revenues generated from the NCS trade facilitation activities, company income tax (CIT), any sale of national assets, surplus and dividends from States Owned Enterprises. Fundamentally, there are two components of the revenue allocation formula used for the disbursement of the Federation Account to the three tiers of government. These are Vertical Allocation Formula and Horizontal Allocation Formula.
