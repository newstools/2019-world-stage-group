Visa Inc plans to acquire a “significant minority” stake in payments platform Interswitch, the Nigeria-based company said on Tuesday. Interswitch did not provide financial details in its statement. The acquisition, which Sky News reported on Sunday as being a 20 per cent stake for 200 million dollars, would give the company a valuation of one billion dollars — putting it in the tech-world “unicorn” status for companies that have a billion-dollar valuation.
