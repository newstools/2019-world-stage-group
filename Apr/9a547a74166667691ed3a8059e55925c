Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has called on Nigerians to undertake official certification of food items being sent abroad to ensure speedy delivery to their countries of destination. Mr Abubakar Usman, Zonal Manager, NIPOST, Abuja,  made this call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja. According to him, the certification of food items from relevant agencies like the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) will help NIPOST make timely deliveries. He also advised that senders of edible commodities should get certification of relevant authorities in the countries of destination of such items. “Some Nigerians that have their wards in other parts of the country come to send food items to them but the only problem we have is that some of the items are prohibited in the countries of destination. “Some of the things that are prohibited include fluid such as oil, water, also guns and animals. If they can logon to our websites, they will find the prohibited items and prohibition depends on countries of destination. “They differ from each country of destination, but my advice is that anyone that wants to send something especially food items should get certification from the countries of destination. “You can also go to agencies like NAFDAC or Quarantine to get the certificate that yes the product had followed the proper procedure and safety standards before it got to NIPOST,’’ Usman said. The zonal manager said agencies like NAFDAC were better qualified to examine the items and have the technical know-how to determine the safety of such items. Usman said the procedure would help eliminate unnecessary delay of the parcel destinations, thereby making the work of NIPOST faster. Usman also urged Nigerians to patronize the over-the-counter services of the organization, adding that NIPOST needed the patronage in order to generate funds.
