Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with his Nephew and long time friend, Alhaji Mamman Daura, on his 80th birthday, congratulating him for many years of love and sacrifices for the nation, especially in his chosen career, journalism. A statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja, Buhari joined all family members and friends of the veteran journalist in celebrating the milestone. President Buhari recalled, with delight, Daura’s remarkable brilliance from childhood at the Katsina Middle School and Government College which caught the attention of Northern Regional Government. According to him, this feat earned him sponsorship for further studies in the United Kingdom in the 50’s and many years to follow, noting that the knowledge had, overtime, only translated into more wisdom. The President rejoiced with the renowned journalist and bibliophile, who worked with the civil service for a while before joining the New Nigerian newspapers, where he rose to be Editor and Managing Director, before venturing to the private sector as entrepreneur. He noted that Daura had inspired industrial growth in the north in furniture making, textile manufacturing, aluminium smelting and other investments. President Buhari assured Daura that his footprint on the development of the country, and quintessential attention to family values, would always be remembered and appreciated. He also extolled him for the visionary role he played in the banking sector and management of companies, and development institutions.
