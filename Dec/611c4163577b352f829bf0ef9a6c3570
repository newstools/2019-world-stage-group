The official news agency, MAP,  reported on Friday that the African Development Bank (AfDB) would grant Morocco 220 million U.S. dollars to support industrialisation at the local level. The programme would help attract more private investors and generate new jobs which would support the regional implementation of Morocco’s industrial acceleration plan, the report said. According to official statistics since 1970, the AfDB group has invested more than 10 billion dollars in multiple strategic sectors of the Moroccan economy.
