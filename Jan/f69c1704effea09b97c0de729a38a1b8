The Senate on Thursday did a great job by ensuring that the bill to protect persons with mental health and substance abuse problems passed the second reading at house. This followed the presentation of the bill by the sponsor, Sen. Ahmadu Abubakar (APC-Adamawa) at plenary. The bill is entitled, “A Bill for an Act to Protect Persons with Mental Health Needs and Establishment of National Commission for Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for Effective Management of Mental Health in Nigeria and for other Related Matters”. Presenting the bill, Abubakar said the bill, which passed first reading on Jan. 23, would provide direction for a coherent response to mental health and substance abuse victims. He said the bill would protect the rights and freedom of persons with mental health and substance abuse problems as well as ensure better quality of life and better service delivery. The lawmaker said further that the bill when passed and signed into law would provide a framework for legalisation to take care of issues around mental health. He lamented that records had it that mental health problems accounted for “the sixth burden worldwide”. Abubukar noted that in spite of the large number of persons suffering the problem in Nigeria, reports had it that there were only “250 psychiatrists in the country”.
