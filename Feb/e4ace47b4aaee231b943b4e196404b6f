The  delay in the passage of the nation’s has  been identified as one of the  factors  hampering capital expenditure and national economic development in the country.
Director General, Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA), Mr Timothy Olawale stated  at a forum in Lagos that the habit of passing the annual budgets late, if allowed to continue, would retard the economy. “NECA decries the recurring delays in the passage of the annual national budgets, which appear to have become a culture. “It is disheartening and worrisome. The continuous delays in budget passage year-on-year is a major source of concern to the Organised Private Sector (OPS),’’ Olawale said. The director-general said that the importance of quick passage of the budget could not be over-emphasised, saying that it played a critical role in economic development. He said that since 2014, the earliest time the budget was passed was in March 2016, whereas Nigeria’s fiscal year began in January and ended in December. “We cannot begin to imagine the consequences of the late passage of the budgets on national development and business growth. “For some years now, the process leading to the approval and passage of the budget in Nigeria has been a victim of the proverbial fighting of two elephants. “Capital expenditure, which to a large extent plays a major role in economic development, suffers,’’ he said. The NECA boss said that infrastructural reforms, which are meant to attract investments and improve the lives of the populace, are put on hold and business decisions, which could translate to expansion and employment, are frustrated. He said that a time frame should be given which should be strictly followed to give importance to the early passage of the budget.
