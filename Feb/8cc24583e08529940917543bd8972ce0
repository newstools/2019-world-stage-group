President Muhammadu Buhari  has commended the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for his roles in ensuring the national economic recovery. President Buhari gave the commendation at a meeting with Ogun State traditional rulers, led by Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo. He particularly lauded Osinbajo’s role as the head of the National Economic Council (NEC). The President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in a statement in Abuja, said the president responded to the Vice President’s presentation at the meeting on the economic outlook in the country in the last four years and how the APC-led administration had done more with less resources. President Buhari said: “He (Osinbajo) being the Chairman of NEC is in a very strong position to know what we are earning and what we are doing with the earnings. ‘‘I am very pleased with his vast experience and intellect. He has captured effectively what the administration has done and I commend him for playing a very great part in that. Thank you, Mr Vice President.’’ The President told the traditional rulers that in all the States he had visited so far for his re-election bid, he had taken time to explain to Nigerians the achievements, programmes and future plans of his government in the three key areas of economy, security and anti-corruption. ‘‘On the promises on security, I have mentioned repeatedly that the people of the North East appreciate our undertakings because you cannot manage a country unless it is secure. “We have succeeded in that and we thank God,’’ he said.
