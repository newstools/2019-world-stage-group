A rally organised on Saturday by the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Dan Anyiam Stadium, Owerri, suffered  a crisis. Supporters of the party’s governorship candidate in the state, Mr Hope Uzodinma,  and those of his Action Alliance (AA) counterpart, Mr Uche Nwosu, engaged  in a fight at the APC women and youths rally. Supporters of Nwosu were chanting victory songs and raising his posters in the air when the clash  began. Security operatives, however, intervened,  shooting sporadically in the air while warding off the VIP stand where Wife of the Vice President, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo, who represented Wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, Aisha, was seated alongside other dignitaries. At least three persons were injured as the crowd dispersed following the gunshots. Reacting, Gov. Rochas Okorocha alleged that the fight was caused by thugs hired by Uzodinma. He described the relationship between AA and APC in the state as good, but  added that Uzodinma would not win the governorship election.
