Officials of the Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and their counterparts in the Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission (EFCC) met on Thursday, March 7, 2019, with the aim of
strengthening the country’s fight against economic crimes. The meeting, which took
place at the Head Office of the CBN in Abuja, provided an opportunity for the
two entities to share experiences and peculiar challenges in the fight against
economic related crimes. The two agencies
adopted strategies aimed at curtailing the unwholesome activities of economic
saboteurs which include smuggling of commodities like rice, textile materials,
fertilizer, wheat and other items on the prohibition list for accessing foreign
exchange through official window, as well as tracking illicit financial flows. Other areas which the two agencies are
collaborating include anti-money laundry and the monitoring of politically
exposed persons in the country. The inter-agency
meeting, chaired by the Director, Governors’ Department of the CBN, Mr.
Jeremiah Abue, also agreed to improve the level of information-sharing and
surveillance of the financial sector. It would be recalled
that the CBN under the auspices of the Bankers’ Committee had said that any
individual or corporate body found to complicit in economic crime or attempts
to circumvent economic laws and regulations of the country may be barred from
operating a bank account in any bank in Nigeria.
