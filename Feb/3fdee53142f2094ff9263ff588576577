The Kwara  State Government has called on  the electorate to keep faith with the Independent National Electoral  Commission (INEC), in its effort to conduct free and fair and acceptable election. Kwara Commissioner for Information and Communications Alhaji Ishak Sabi gave the advice in an interview on Tuesday in Okuta, Baruten Local Government Area of the state, while reacting to the postponement of the general elections by INEC. According to him, Nigeria will surmount all the challenges bedeviling its electoral processes. “We will overcome these challenges and that is why we are saying, that able and capable leaders should be at every position. “We must do away with sentiments, religious bigotry, and tribal affiliation in this country,“ he said.
