WorldStage Newsonline– Nigerian Communications
Commission (NCC), the country’s independent telecom regulatory authority, has highlighted
his ongoing efforts towards engendering security of lives and property for
economic development in our country, saying the telecoms industry, in the past
18 years had recorded tremendous growth. Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice
Chairman/CEO, NCC in his remark at the third annual conference of the Guild of
Corporate Online Publishers on October 4, 2019 in Lagos, said the number
of active telephone lines in the country at about 175 million, representing a
teledensity of 91.65 per cent.. Represented by Mr Omoniyi Ibietan, Head, Online Media and Special Publication, he said, “Today, the number of Internet users is 122.6 million while broadband penetration currently stands at 35 percent. The cumulative investment profile in the sector is over $70 billion. “At 11.39 percent contribution to the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), the telecom subsector remains a major actor in the
national economy. Indeed, as at the second quarter of 2019, Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) sector’s contribution to the GDP was 13.88 per
cent. “Today, the positive impacts of telecoms sector
– either voice or data resonate in other sectors of the economy and in all the
aspects of our daily interactions.” On the theme of the GOCOP event: “Economy,
Security and National Development: The Way Forward in Nigeria”, he said it “is
very apt and timely, as it speaks to the fundamental issues that underpin our
development outlook as a nation.” He said GOCOP over the years, remained a
segment of the Commission’s broad media stakeholders, who had continually
supported in disseminating our activities – policies, programmes and decisions
– to its various stakeholders. 

“We are, indeed, grateful for the professional manner with which you
cover our activities from time to time,” he said.
