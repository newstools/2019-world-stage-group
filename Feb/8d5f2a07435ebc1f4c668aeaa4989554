UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU) must not be frustrated. Local media reported that May also said that the government must focus on delivering it. May is trying to get changes to the Brexit package before putting it to another vote in parliament. If she fails, May will have to decide whether to delay Brexit or endanger the world’s fifth largest economy by leaving without a deal on March 29. “Our focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute. “We must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country’s history. “In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus,” May told Conservative Party activists on Saturday. Three British cabinet ministers have publicly indicated they will back plans to delay Brexit if lawmakers vote down May’s plan for a new deal with the EU. Business Minister Greg Clark, Work and Pensions Minister Amber Rudd and Justice Minister David Gauke signaled in a Daily Mail column that they would side with rebels and opposition parties to stop Britain leaving without a deal if necessary. May has promised that if she does not bring a revised deal back by Feb. 27, parliament will have an opportunity to vote on the next steps. Some lawmakers are expected to use that to try to wrest control of the process from the government.
