As part of efforts to kick polio out of Nigeria, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Primary Health Care Board has announced plans to begin a fresh polio vaccination exercise on Saturday, Jan. 26. The board announced the commencement of the exercise during an orientation programme on Out-Break Response (OBR) organised for newsmen. Mr Abdulkazeez Idris, Director of Pharmaceutical Services of the board, said at the programme that Nigeria was one of three countries in the world that still had polio issues. “There are three countries in the world that still have issues with polio; Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. “Nigeria is the only country in Africa that still has the challenge of polio and we are determined to change that story in the next one year. “We will hold the immunisation exercise between 26th and 29th of January and we hope to capture all infants of five years old and below,’’ Idris said. He urged all parents to allow their children to benefit from the exercise.
