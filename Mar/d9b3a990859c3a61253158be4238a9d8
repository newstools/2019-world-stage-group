The Kogi Election Petition Tribunal for the 2019 General Elections has been moved to Abuja. The Secretary of the tribunal, Mrs Aisha Mana, confirmed this in a statement issued in Lokoja on Wednesday. Mana said that the tribunal, which was earlier scheduled to sit in Lokoja, will now hold its sessions at the Federal High Court, Abuja. She, however, did not give any reason for the relocation of the tribunal. The action may not be unconnected with the ongoing strike by judiciary workers in the state. The  Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) Kogi Chapter, had embarked on an indefinite strike on Dec. 11, 2018 over unpaid salary arrears of six months. The Kogi tribunal was set up to hear complaints arising from the 2019 national and state assembly elections.
