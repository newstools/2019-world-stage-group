Britain’s highest court on Monday says it will rule on Tuesday whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament is unlawful, in a decision that could prove crucial for Johnson’s political future and Brexit. The Supreme Court said a ruling on the legal challenges to Conservative Johnson’s prorogation or suspension of parliament, would be issued at 10:30 a.m (or 0930 GMT) on Tuesday. The court heard two main legal challenges to the government leader’s decision to pause the British parliament’s work until Oct. 14. This, he insisted was to allow him time to present a new government programme to a fresh session of parliament.His opponents, including some pro-EU Conservative lawmakers, accuse Johnson of suspending the legislature to limit scrutiny of his plans for Britain to leave the EU, with or without a deal, on Oct. 31. Following last week’s Supreme Court hearing before 11 judges, Johnson told newsmen that he has great respect for the judiciary in Britain, but declined to say what he might do if the court rules against him. “I will wait to see what transpires,” he said. A lawyer for the government told the hearing that Johnson would obey any ruling that the suspension was unlawful, but he suggested that any recall of parliament might not be immediate.
