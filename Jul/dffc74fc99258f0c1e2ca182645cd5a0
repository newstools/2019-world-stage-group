Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says Britain is seeking to assemble a “European-led maritime protection mission” to ensure safe travel of cargo through the vital Strait of Hormuz. Hunt’s announcement of the new operation during a speech in Parliament comes days after Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker in the strait. Two weeks earlier British Royal Marines helped capture an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar. “Because freedom of navigation is a vital interest of every nation, we will now seek to put together a European-led maritime protection mission to support both safe passage of crew and cargo in this vital region,” Hunt said. He said Britain has had “constructive” conversations with a number of countries over the past two days and said the mission would complement similar efforts under way by Washington. “It will not be part of the US ‘maximum pressure’ policy on Iran because we remain committed to preserving the Iran nuclear agreement,” he said. The Department of Transport has raised the security level for British-flagged shipping to level 3 and continues to advise against all passage through the Strait of Hormuz, Hunt said.
