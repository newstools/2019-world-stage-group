As Nigerians prepare for the general elections scheduled for February 16 and March 2,   the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that the elections are free, fair and credible for national interest. TUC disclosed this in a communiqué signed by the TUC President,  Bobboi Bala  Kaigama after the  National Executive Council meeting of the union in Lagos. Kaigama called  on the Federal Government to avoid all forms of intimidation and be transparent in the conduct of the forthcoming general elections. According to the statement, the TUC “calls on the INEC to be as impartial as possible, having the interest of all Nigerians at heart. It also calls on the police, the military and other security agents to be professional in discharging their duties since no position is worth the blood of innocent civilians”. The union commended the House of Representatives for approving N30,000.00 as new minimum wage  and called on the Senate to do same without any further delay. It commended the Federal Government for the fight against corruption, but called on the government to respect the rule of law. The Union called on the Federal Government to intensify efforts to end  killings, kidnapping and insurgency in the country to save  the country from total collapse.
