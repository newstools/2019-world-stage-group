Dr Ramatu Aliyu, FCT Minister of State on Sunday  commended the emergence of Chief Edward Onoja, as Deputy Governor of Kogi State, following the impeachment of Mr Simon Achuba by the State Assembly. Aliyu made the commendation in a statement issued by her Special Assistant on Media, Mr Austine Elemue in Abuja. She described the choice of Onoja as a perfect political combination for the state and the ruling All Progressives Party (APC) in the Nov. 16 governorship election. Aliyu also described the relationship between Gov. Yahaya Bello and Onoja as trustworthy and cordial, noting that their relationship predates the emergence of Bello in 2016. “Onoja has been an ally of the governor for long as their relationship goes way back. A friend is someone difficult to find and someone you can always count on when times are tough. “A friend understands that you may not always get along, but you should always try and be there for them and look out for them.”
