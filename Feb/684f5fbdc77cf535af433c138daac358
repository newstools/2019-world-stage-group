WorldStage Newsonline—- The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Mr Adams Oshiomhole has called on Nigerians to back President  Muhammadu Buhari, saying no responsible candidate or individual should find fault in the President’s directive on ballot box Snatching during the forthcoming elections. Oshiomhole stated this  in Abuja at a news conference while reacting to a  critical statement made by Atiku Abubakar, PDP Presidential Candidate on President Muhammadu Buhari’s riot act to thugs and ballot box snatchers. President Buhari  at the APC expanded National Caucus meeting on Monday, warned that any politician that sponsored thugs or ballot box snatchers, would be dealt with by security operatives. The President  said that security operatives have been instructed to deal with such persons. “Atiku has called on the President to retract his instruction to security agencies regarding violence, ballot box thieves, and other electoral malpractices. “The question is how such instruction disturbs anyone that is truly interested in free, fair and credible elections,” Oshiomhole said and described PDP and Atiku’s reactions as shameful. Oshiomhole said  the APC was not surprised because  PDP has marshalled plans to get to power by all means possible. The APC national chairman said  that the option of one man one vote is not on  PDP’s table. He said  Atiku  by his statement has admitted that he is  not popular by recently claiming that he had two geopolitical zones while the APC has  four other geopolitical zones. Oshiomhole stressed that Atiku and the PDP should prepare for the shock of their lives on the election day.
