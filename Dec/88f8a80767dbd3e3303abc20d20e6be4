The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Tuesday, December 31, 2019 handed over a forfeited property to the National Directorate of Employment, NDE, for use as office. The property, located on Plot 1076 Cadastral Zone, Sector B 18, Gudu District, Abuja was recovered in a case between the Federal Government and Emmanuel Enesi Ozigi and two others, namely: Home Vestors Concepts Ltd & Knight Consulting Ltd. The EFCC secured the final forfeiture of the property to the Federal Government on February 15, 2018, at the conclusion of forfeiture processes in a Federal High Court, Abuja, presided over by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu. The hand over formalities were conducted by the Secretary to EFCC, Olanipekun Olukoyede, who conveyed the Commissionâ€™s excitement at handing the property over to an agency of the Federal Government, noting that the gesture, like the others that preceded it, testifies to the successes of the anti-corruption fight. Director General of NDE, Dr Nasiru Mohammed Ladan in his remarks, commended the Acting Chairman of EFCC, Ibrahim Magu for his relentless efforts in the anti-corruption fight, and expressed happiness that the NDE now has an office it could call its own, having occupied rented offices for 32 years.
