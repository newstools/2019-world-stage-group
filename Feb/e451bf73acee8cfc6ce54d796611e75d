The Edo State Governor,  Godwin Obaseki of Edo has promised to  reduce the irregular migration and human trafficking figure in the state by 50 per cent by the end of 2019. Obaseki stated this in a speech at a one day specialised training with the theme, “How to Bridge the Gap between Investigation and Prosecution,” held at the Government House, Benin, on Tuesday. He said about 4,800 returnees from foreign countries had been welcomed back to the state after going through horrible experiences while seeking for greener pastures abroad. “While dealing with the crime of human trafficking, my administration is looking at the causes so as to provide better quality education and technical training for jobs,” he said. He said the state government was receiving greater support from the international community as the state combated the scourge of human trafficking. “For us in Edo, we realise we have a problem which has led to several steps being taken to solve it,” he said.
