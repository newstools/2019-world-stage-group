I went to Atlanta to visit our sister organisations there and to inaugurate many of our organisations. “I also went to Detroit where we inaugurated some of the organisations. We also have many Buhari support organisations in New York as well. “We have Buharists in the United States and all over the world. So I am here to encourage them and to support them in every way we can,” he said. He said his support for Buhari was because he stood out among other presidential candidates because of his determination to bequeath a secured future for the youth of Nigeria. He said Buhari had opened up the space for the youth of the country to participate politically and economically.
