Speaking on the market performance, Omordion expressed optimism that the stock market would end 2019 on a negative note going by trends posted so far. He stated that the possibility of the market closing positive was very slim due to mismatch in fiscal and monetary policies. According to him, the implementation of the 2019 budget has not reflected on the economy.
