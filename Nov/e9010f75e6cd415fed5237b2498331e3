The leadership of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) has adopted a new technology for HIV screening. Dr Yewande Olafa, NACA Assistant Director, Community Prevention and Care Services disclosed this while speaking in Abuja, on Saturday. Olafa said the new technology was that of a non blood based test kit, designed to promote privacy and confidence among users. She said that the screening kit was oral based with simplicity, accuracy and fastness in ascertaining one’s HIV status. “It is in line with commemoration of World Aids Day with the title, “Community makes the difference,” in which we are engaging the community to help in reduction of HIV spread,” Olafa said. She urged Nigerians to embrace the new technology for HIV screening, saying that HIV detection was not the end of life. ” If you are positive with oraquick, don’t conclude yet, go for confirmation in a nearby hospital facility,” she said. The NACA Assistant Director restated the readiness of the agency to continue to reduce HIV infection through testing and awareness creation. Also speaking, Ms Rhoda Ajibola, expressed satisfaction with the oral test kit which according to her was portable and efficient. Ajibola, who said that the kit would help reduce stigma, noted that it was very effective and qualitative in testing HIV and commended NACA for the initiative.
