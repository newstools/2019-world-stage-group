He quoted the minister as saying “Nigerian youths are not problematic, but an asset to the nation, as the nation plans to scalethem up and create opportunities for them. Our youths are not yet equipped for the 21st century jobs. “The Federal Government, through the ministry, is resolutely committed to equip them for the 21st century challenges. “It is a world of digital technology and the minds of our youths can take all better than the older generation. “From our research, we found out that the best place to meet our youths is online. So, we came up with Nigeria OnlineYouth Assembly (NOYA), which is an aggregator website, a one stop shop to connect our youths, to be launched soon.” Dare said that the ministry has other innovative initiative ideas in the pipeline such as Digital Youth Nigeria. He added that others were; Work Experience Programme (WEP), where youths would be on three to six months internship with about 50 corporate firms to gain experience that would make them employable. He noted that another initiative of the ministry — Digital Literacy, Entrepreneurship, Employment and Leadership (DEEL) skill would expose youths to many business ventures. He agreed to partner with the NGO to educate youths to develop their potential.
