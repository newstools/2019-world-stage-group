Zimbabwe’s inflation accelerated to a new 10-year high of 56.9 per cent year-on-year in January, from 42.09 per cent in December, the country’s statistics agency Zimstats said on Friday.
Zimstats said in Harare that the height was propelled by increases in the price of basic goods and beer.
On a monthly basis, prices increased 10.75 per cent in January, compared to 9.03 per cent in December.
