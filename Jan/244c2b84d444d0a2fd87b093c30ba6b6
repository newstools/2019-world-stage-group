No fewer than 2,220 teachers and securitymen have been recruited into primary schools in Cross River State from over 20,000 applications received during the recruitment process. Dr Stephen Odey, Chairman, Cross River Universal Basic Education Board said this on Monday in Calabar while addressing journalists on the outcome of the exercise conducted in Nov. 2018. He said that employment letters were already being issued to successful candidates, adding that they would commence work immediately in their area of postings. The chairman said that the recruitment followed approval by Gov. Ben Ayade to replace dead and retired primary school teachers in the state. According to him, all the successful applicants were selected on merit after a rigorous interview exercise. “We received about 20,000 applications; we shortlisted over 5000 for interviews and today we selected 2,220 as approved by His Excellency,” he said. Out of the 2,220, 1818 are teachers and 402 are security men. Odey said that the number of teachers employed had gradually reduced the number of unemployed graduates in the state. “We thank the governor for this because it is another sure way of reducing the rising unemployment in the state,” Odey said.
