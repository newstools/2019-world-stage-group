Gov. Kayode Fayemi of  Ekiti State  has banned roadside trading and indiscriminate parking of vehicles. To this end, the government said it would commence the full enforcement of the road traffic laws from Jan. 1, 2020. The Head of the State Road Traffic Management Agency (EKSTMA), Mr Olufemi Olanrewaju, in a statement issued in Ado Ekiti on Monday said the action had become necessary to reduce incessant cases of avoidable accidents. He said that this would also ensure free flow of traffic in all parts of the state. “Beginning from January 1, 2020, the agency would no longer allow display of wares by the roadside by traders. “Use of wheelbarrows, particularly, in Ado Ekiti city centre for purpose of hawking items will also be restricted,” he said. According to him, the policy would also add value to the ongoing face lift initiated by the present administration aimed at giving the state capital a deserved befitting outlook. “The restriction would also help in instilling sanity to the current indiscriminate use of the roads in a manner that often create inconvenience and discomfort to others. “Also to be affected in the exercise, are vehicle dealers in the habit of displaying their products too close to the roads, including other vehicle owners and drivers who usually abandon or park anyhow by the road side. “Tipper drivers have also been warned against dropping sands and gravel by the road side. “Consequently, the agency has asked all affected roadside traders and wheelbarrow users to comply with an earlier directive of the state government. “The directive urged the wheelbarrow pushers to relocate to new markets such as Awedele and Agric Olope in Ado Ekiti.
