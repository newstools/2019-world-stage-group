WorldStage NewsOnline—-No fewer than 13 state assembly members-elect under  the People’s Democratic Party (PDP)  boycotted INEC’s issuance of certificate of return  on Wednesday in Kano State due to security reasons. A statement by Sanusi Bature Dawakin-Tofa, PDP’s Spokesperson for 2019 Campaign Management Team in Kano State made this known in Kano on Wednesday. Dawakin-Tofa said the party asked its members to boycott the exercise because the Sani Abacha Indoor Sports Hall, which was the venue of the ceremony, was not conducive due to serious security reasons. “We have a serious concern over the selection of venue for issuance of certificate of return to our State Assembly Members elect. “There should be a neutral ground for the exercise, PDP members are not safe in the venue selected which is indoor stadium of Kofar Mata Sports Complex,” Dawakin-Tofa said. According to him, the party had before now written to the commission requesting for a change of venue to maintain neutrality as it happened in 2011 and 2015.
