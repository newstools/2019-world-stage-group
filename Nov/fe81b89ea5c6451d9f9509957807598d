The management of National Population Commission (NPopC) has commenced data collection for the 2019 Verbal and Social Autopsy (VASA) survey in Adamawa. Speaking on the exercise at a briefing in Yola on Friday, Dr Clifford Zirra, the Federal Commissioner for Adamawa, said the four weeks nationwide exercise was in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health. Zirra said the exercise was to obtain data for determining the causes and contributors to deaths in children aged 0 to five years. “The objective of the study includes the provision of up-to-date information on early childhood mortality rate, estimation of prevalence, determination of cultural/behavioural/social and health system factors of neonatal, infant and under-five mortality using the 2018 NDHS household. “Pursuant to its constitutional mandate of providing demographic data for planning purposes, the National Population Commission in collaboration with Federal Ministry of Health and other government MDAs will be conducting the survey to assist policy makers plan and formulate policies for the health sector in relation to maternal and child health in Nigeria,” Zirra said. He explained that two teams would be conducting the exercise, comprising Quantitative Team that would focus on responses from caregivers in the households, while Qualitative Team would focus on focus group discussions and in-debt interviews with households and communities. The NPopC federal commissioner urged government officials, security agencies, media, traditional rulers and religious leaders to accord the exercise the needed support to succeed.
