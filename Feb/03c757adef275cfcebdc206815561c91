WorldStage Newsonline—- The Federal Government has backed the effort of oil-producing nations to reduce output to attract higher prices in the global market. A statement by Garba Shehu, Media and Publicity Aide to the President, said President Muhammadu Buhari made this position known when he received Mr Ahmad Qattan, Minister of State for African Affairs and Special Envoy of King Salman Bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia. In the statement, the president said that Nigeria was, as a responsible member of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), willing to go along with the Saudi initiative of limiting oil output to push up prices. He said that output cuts had always been difficult for Nigeria considering its peculiar circumstances of large population, huge expanse of land and state of under-development, adding, “I wish we can produce more. “I have listened carefully to the message. I will speak with the Minister of State for Petroleum. I will call for the latest production figures. “I know that it is in our interest to listen. We will cooperate.” He said that higher oil prices would make both nations stronger and their citizens more prosperous. Buhari commended the Saudi monarch for his leadership in global oil matters, assuring that Nigeria would continue to accord respect to the Kingdom in that regard.
