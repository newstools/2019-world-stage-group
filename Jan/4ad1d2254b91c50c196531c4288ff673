The absence of counsel to suspended Director-General of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mounir Gwarzo,  on Thursday stalled the matter before the National Industrial Court, Abuja. At the resumed sitting slated for hearing of counter-affidavit and other pending applications, the claimant’s counsel Abdulhakeem Mustapha (SAN), notified the court of his absence through a junior counsel from his chamber. The counsel, Sani Umoru, sought for a date convenient to the court. The judge, Justice Sanusi Kado, asked Abduljalil Musa, Chinedu Achumie and Abdullahi Abubakar first, second and third defendants counsel respectively, if they had any objection to the submissions of Umoru. The counsel said they had no objection, while the judge adjourned the matter until Feb. 28 for hearing. Gwarzo, is challenging his suspension as D-G. The claimant was suspended in November 2017, over alleged financial misappropriation. He is seeking a declaration that his appointment as D-G of SEC is valid, legal and subsisting. The suspended D-G is also seeking an order of the court to direct the first defendant (SEC) to pay his salaries, benefits and entitlements from the date of his suspension till date. The co- defendants in the suit are the Minister of Finance and Attorney-General of the Federation.
