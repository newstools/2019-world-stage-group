He said: “I am here on an on the spot assessment and going round few of the pavilions at the trade fair. “As you can see, I have to come in here to encourage our MSMEs that are on display. “This is real governance and collaborative initiative. This is an annual event, but we need to upscale it.” Sanwo-Olu commended the LCCI for keeping faith with MSMEs, adding that it shows the can-do spirit of Nigeria.
