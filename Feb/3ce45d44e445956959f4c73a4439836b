In a bid to meet current challenges in the education sector, the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), has called for a review of  the curriculum in Nigeria’s schools. Director-General, Industrial Training Fund (ITF). Mr. Mroseph Ari stated this on Thursday in Jos. “There is the need to review the curriculum in schools to ensure more focus on the development of basic skills to meet present and future challenges of globalization. “As a nation, our curriculum was faulty from the beginning; too much emphasis was placed on paper qualification rather than skills acquisition. “We have graduates of engineering who are unable to handle simple machines. They know the theories but lack basic skills knowledge,” Ari said. The ITF boss suggested that more attention should be paid to empowering people with relevant skills right from the kindergarten stage. “Our curriculum must be restructured to meet the needs of the country; we must strive to reduce poverty by encouraging skills for income generation. “Young Nigerians need a curriculum that will encourage high participation in technical and vocational education,” he said.
