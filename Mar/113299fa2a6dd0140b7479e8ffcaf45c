WorldStage NewsOnline—Following the move by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) to resume collation of the governorship election result in Bauchi state, the State Governor, Mohammed Abdullahi  on Monday visited the presidential villa to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari. INEC had on Friday decided to resume the collation of the governorship election result in Bauchi State and may declare the winner of the poll, hitherto ruled as inconclusive along with five other states across the country. The Presidency had on Sunday distanced President Muhammadu Buhari from the activities of INEC. The  governor had met with Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo last week and declined to speak on the outcome of the meeting. Speaking to State House correspondents after the closed door meeting with president, the governor revealed that he briefed the president on the latest political development in Bauchi state. He explained that the position of INEC regarding result of the Bauchi governorship election was capable of creating social unrest. However, the Presidency in a statement by Malam Garba Shehu on Sunday said the president had vowed never to interfere in the forthcoming re-run elections in some states, describing it as unfair and ridiculous criticisms of President Buhari’s apparent disinterest in the exercise. “Past Presidents of Nigeria were known to interfere in inconclusive elections, and that is why party members appear to be upset that the same thing is not happening now, but President Buhari is a different kind of leader. “He swore to defend the constitution and will not veer off from that. The constitution of Nigeria gives the President no such powers,’’ the statement said.
