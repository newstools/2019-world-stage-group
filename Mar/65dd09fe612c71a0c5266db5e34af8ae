The  Presidential Candidate of the National Rescue Movement, (NRM) Mr Usman Ibrahim-Alhaji has dragged President Muhammadu Buhari and the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar to court over alleged excess spending on campaigns. Ibrahim-Alhaji  is praying the court to invoke Section 91(2) of the Electoral Act, 2010 to nullify the participation of Buhari and Atiku in the Feb. 23 presidential election or allegedly violating the Electoral Act 2010. The plaintiff through his counsel, Mr Ezekiel  Ofou is praying the court to set aside the participation of Buhari and Atiku on the grounds that they spent over N1  billion each as campaign expenses. He alleged that by spending over N1 billion each, Buhari and Atiku violated the electoral law and are liable to be removed as contestants in the election. When the matter came up on Tuesday, Ofou told the that he found it extremely difficult to serve the court papers on Buhari and Atiku, who were the main defendants in the suit because of the retinue of security around them.Ofou then moved an ex parte motion in which he prayed the court for an order of substituted service on the two major defendants.

The trial judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed in a short ruling, granted the application for substituted service.Buhari and Atiku are to be served through the legal departments of the All Progressives Congress (APC)  the PDP respectively.
