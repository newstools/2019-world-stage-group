The Federal Government has called on State Governments to take up the responsibility of providing water for its people. Mr Suleiman Adamu, the Minister of Water Resources made this call at a Forum in Abuja on Friday. He said that many state governments were not investing in water and sanitation and had abandoned their responsibility for the Federal Government. “It is not the role of the Federal Government to provide water. The role of the federal ministry of water resources is to provide bulk water and manage the water resources of this country. “Whatever we are doing is just an intervention to complement the efforts of the states. “The primary responsibility for water supply rest with the states that is why this ministry does not run Water Corporation. “It is only the FCT, which is a territorial administration in Abuja that runs a water board. FCT is a territory, so it is like a state. So that needs to be made clear, so whatever we are doing is just an intervention to complement the efforts of the states. “What I have realised is that in the past 10 or so years, many states unfortunately have abdicated their responsibility, they are not investing in water and sanitation. “That is why you see communities in the remotest end  writing to the ministry of water resources to provide water scheme in their locations. “It is not our responsibility. But if they are special situations like the IDP camps, and so on, those are places that we can also intervene.’’ Adamu said that the Federal Government brought the concept of Partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation & Hygiene (PEWASH) as a way of making state governments invest in water and sanitation.
