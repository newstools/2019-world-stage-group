Secretary of  Iran’s Supreme National Security Council said on Wednesday  there will be no war with the U.S,. The state news agency IRNA, quoted Ali Shamkhani  as saying: ” there will not be a military confrontation between Iran and America since there is no reason for a war. ”Accusing other countries has turned into a common practice among U.S. officials as they try to pressure other counties.” Worries about a military confrontation between Iran and the U.S. have mounted since attacks  on June 13, on two oil tankers near the Gulf. Washington blamed long-time foe Iran for the attacks but  Tehran denied any responsibility. Nonetheless, U.S., NAN reports that diplomats warned commercial airliners flying over the Persian Gulf that they faced a risk of being “misidentified” amid heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran.The U.S. has ordered bombers and an aircraft carrier to the Gulf over an unexplained perceived threat, raising tensions a year after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal between world powers and the Islamic Republic.
