WorldStage Newsonline—-In a bid to check incidences of phone theft in the country, Association of Mobile Communications Device Technicians (AMCODET) has announced plan to partner the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). The National President of the association, Mr Apara Ige, disclosed this in an interview  in Abuja. Ige said that the partnership became necessary following the ease at which phones were stolen and AMCODET membersarrested for crimes they never committed. He said “we recently got a lot of reports from our members who were arrested wrongly because they unlocked stolen phones. “Due to such unpleasant reports, we approached the police to introduce a solution called `Mobile Phone Unlocking Clearance Permit’ and Unlocking Acceptance forms. “The form will have to be filled by the customer at the point of unlocking any phone by an engineer who is our member and presented to the police in case of any issues. “We have been in series of meetings with the Intelligence Response Team of the Police to buy into this idea which can reduce phone theft across the country.” He recognised that the police were doing their job by securing lives and properties, but it was important the real criminals were indicted for their crimes.
