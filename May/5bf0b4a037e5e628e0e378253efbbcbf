Uber drivers across the United States will switch off their apps and go on a two-hour strike on Wednesday. Tensions are high among drivers as the U.S.-based transport networking service is poised to make its debut on the New York Stock Exchange this week. In Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and several other cities across the country, drivers from Uber and rival ride-share apps including Lyft will strike and hold rallies in protest at company policies. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, one of the groups calling for the strikes, said drivers were asking for job security. They saw it as unfair “deactivations” of drivers, a regulation of fares, and a cap on company commission to ensure drivers get 80 to 85 per cent of the fare for each ride. Uber dominates the smartphone app-based ride-sharing market, and also offers food delivery services, freight intermediation for truck drivers, and e-bike and scooter sharing. The Uber initial public offering (IPO) will be on a huge scale, with the company aiming at a total valuation of up to 90 billion dollars. However, the company has posted only large losses to date.
