WorldStage NewsOnline—-The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), said that the Federal Government had no plan to increase the pump price of petrol. Mr Antai Asuquo, the Operations Controller of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Warri Zonal Office, made this disclosure to newsmen on Tuesday on a sideline during the celebration of the “World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development” held simultaneously in all the DPR offices in the country. The annual event with the theme, ” Exploring Nigeria’s Diversity and Rich Cultural Heritage” was organised by the DPR. The controller urged Nigerians to be focused and stop worrying about possible fuel hike that could lead to crisis in the supply chain, adding that ‘the product is available and the pump price remains N145 per litre’. “There is availability of petroleum products, the price of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) remains the same and there is no immediate plan to change it. “We should not hoard the product for a particular period of time because keeping the product at home is dangerous. “Our lives and property are important, so we should value and manage our resources in a way that we do not cause harm to ourselves,” he advised. Asuquo also urged Nigerians to key into the federal government’s policy on the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), noting that there was abundant cooking gas in the country. “The federal government is trying to enforce the availability of cooking gas all over the federation and people are encouraged to use it. “The LPG is the energy of the future, it is cleaner, most sustainable and we have abundant of it. “I encourage people to follow the government’s policies and we will be happy for it,” he said. On the World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, Asuquo said Nigeria remained an indivisible entity irrespective of our ethnic, religious and cultural differences.
