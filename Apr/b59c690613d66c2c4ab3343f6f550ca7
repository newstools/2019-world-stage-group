Mohammed Abubakar of the APC who scored 500,625 votes.Also speaking, Abubakar said he decided to approach the tribunal after a directive from the APC.“Just like I said, I am an obedient member of the national body of the party; it is because of this, that all these three places that I went to, each one of them said the APC will file a suit in court to challenge the governorship election results in the state. “As an obedient member, I accepted to go with that decision. Everyone knows when the results of the election were announced, I conceded defeat but I contested on the ticket of the party and the party has refused to accept the outcome,” he said
