Rev. Samson Ayokunle, the  President, Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN), says desperation by politicians, ahead of the 2019 general elections is generating palpable fear among Nigerians. Ayokunle spoke on Thursday in Abuja, at the National Ecumenical Centre,  during a special prayer session, organised by CAN, ahead of the 2019 general elections. The CAN president also cautioned electoral officers against manipulating election results to favour a particular candidate. He condemned the “zero sum, winner takes all,” mentality of politicians, stressing that it was not in the spirit of democracy. Ayokunle, said: “We have seen the desperation of politicians, many of who have taken others to court in flagrant disobedience of their parties. “Some are even buying votes to win elections, engage in zero sum game, winner takes all mentality; this is not the spirit of democracy. “So, all these are generating palpable fear, I want somebody to focus on the promised land, not the way to the promised land. I see a successful Nigeria.” Bishop Praise Daniel, the Chairman, Pentecostal Forum, Northern Nigeria, who also spoke, reminded politicians that desperation would not guarantee victory. “Nigerians must go out and vote, and we must vote for worthy leaders; leaders that love the nation, not their pockets. “We must vote leaders that will build infrastructure, that can change the narratives in our nation,” he said. CAN had declared Jan.10 as National Day of Prayers for peaceful, free, fair and credible election and freedom for Leah Sharibu and others in the captivity of the Boko Haram terrorists.
