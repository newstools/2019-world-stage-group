WorldStage Newsonline– The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation DIRAN MIKIYA has confirmed the destruction of another armed bandits’ hideout and neutralized several of their fighters near Doumbourou Hill in Zamfara State. According to a statement by Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force, the attack was executed on 2 January 2019, following human intelligence (HUMINT) reports, which were later confirmed by Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, indicating that a large number of bandits, armed with high calibre weapons, regularly assemble at a compound around the foot of the Hill before going out on operations. It said, accordingly, the ATF scrambled 2 Nigerian Air Force (NAF) attack helicopters, supported by an ISR platform, to engage the bandits and destroy their compound. The helicopters strafed the target area in successive waves of attack, with the first wave causing some damage to the structures and neutralizing some of their fighters. “The second wave was sequenced to engage the armed bandits as they re-emerged out of their hiding places, thus inflicting further fatalities on them. Credible HUMINT sources later revealed that the leader of the group was amongst those killed during the attack,” the statement said. “The ATF, will continue to work in close coordination with surface forces and other security agencies, to conduct reconnaissance and air interdiction missions with a view to restoring normalcy to the affected States in the Northwest. “
