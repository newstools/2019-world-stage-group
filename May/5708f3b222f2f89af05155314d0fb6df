The Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) has expressed concern over the activities of hawkers along major roads and streets of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Mr Muktar Ibrahim, Head of Information and Outreach Programme of the agency made this known in an interview on Friday in Abuja. Ibrahim said that activities of the hawkers inside traffics had constituted threats to motorists and their own safety in the metropolis. The AEPB official said as a means of checking the menace of the hawkers, security agents would keep arresting and prosecuting them in line with the laws of the FCT. “We express concern over the risk being taken by these hawkers in their attempt to make brisk business from moving vehicles. “You will see these people waving in and out of traffic, engaging in trading.“Whenever they see men from the monitoring and the enforcement arms of the AEPB, they keep running up and down. “This is another source of worry to the AEPB, as our monitoring teams carry out their operations,” he said.
