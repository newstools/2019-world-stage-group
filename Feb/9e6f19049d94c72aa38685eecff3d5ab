The Ohaneze Ndigbo,  apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation has expressed shock and disappointment over postponement of the Feb. 16 presidential and National Assembly elections. The organisation however, said that it would not draw conclusions on the matter yet until after the stakeholders meeting slated by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to clarify the circumstances. The Assistant National Publicity Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Mr Chuks Ibegbu disclosed this on Saturday in Enugu while reacting to the shift in the dates of the general elections. The electoral body arising from a meeting of its national commissioners early hours of Saturday announced a shift in the dates of the general elections. The presidential and NASS elections that were scheduled to hold on Feb. 16 were shifted to Feb. 23 while the governorship and state houses of assembly elections that were slated for March 3 were rescheduled to March 9. The INEC in its preliminary reports cited logistical challenges as the major reason for the shift in dates.
