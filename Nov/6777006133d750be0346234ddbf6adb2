South Sudan peace monitors on Wednesday said the review of the public finance management (PFM) laws would next week facilitate the effective implementation of the reforms stipulated in the peace deal. Augostino Njoroge, Interim Chairperson of the reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission said that the review of PFM laws would be done ahead of the formation of a new unity government. Njoroge said critical and effective use of resources during the transitional period would spur the growth of the economy and facilitate national reconstruction. “Given the importance of the economic and financial sector to the implementation of the agreement, it is essential that experts and stakeholders, including the PFM institutions, are fully involved in the reform. “Experts and others should be involved in identifying the areas where reforms are needed as well as the actual reforms,’’ Njoroge said. According to the revitalised agreement on the resolution of the conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, the transitional unity government is mandated to carry out radical reforms and transformation of public financial management systems to ensure transparency and accountability. Salvatore Garang Mabiordit, Finance Minister of South Sudan, said the necessary reforms to the PFM sector would strengthen fiscal responsibility, accountability, and control in the management of public funds during the next three-year transitional period. The minister was speaking during the first opening day of the experts and stakeholder’s two-day workshop on the review of PFM sector laws organised by the National Constitutional Amendment Committee.
