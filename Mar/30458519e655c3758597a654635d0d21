Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd. , told NAN that consumers goods stocks, in spite of weak result expected from the sector, dominated gainers due to market sentiments. Omordion said that Dangote Flour, in spite of mixed and weak quarterly financial released to the market, still emerged the best performing stock due to low valuation. He attributed the growth to low valuation and investors’ expectations of full year earnings result that would hit the market any moment.

Others were Cement Company of Northern Nigeria, Total, International Breweries and Academy Press.
