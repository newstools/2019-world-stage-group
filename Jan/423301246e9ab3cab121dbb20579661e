Nigerian Army has denied media reports that herdsmen killed 15 Benue indigenes in a renewed attack on communities in the state. Maj.Gen Adeyemi Yekini, Force Commander, Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), who denied the report in a statement signed by him on Saturday in Makurdi, said there were no such killings in the state. ” The headquarters of OPWS, wish to state that the force did not receive any report of a single killing or even injury inflicted by armed herdsmen on anybody in any part of Benue state in the past several months. ” OPWS has troops in all the areas mentioned including Makurdi and there is no way up to 15 people would be killed without our troops being aware of it. ” Such a large number of killings would have triggered exodus of people in the affected communities , which journalists would have captured almost as they happen. ” There are also other security agencies on ground including traditional, military units, Police, Civil Defense and DSS personnel, who would have filed reports of the killings through their respective channels while also exchanging such information with us. ” HQ OPWS is requesting the good people of Benue to disregard the news and go about their normal business activities without fear, with assurance that OPWS remains resolutely committed to restoring lasting peace to Benue State.”
