German Chancellor Angela Merkel, on Tuesday called for accelerated efforts in tackling climate change in her New Year’s speech broadcast. “The warming of our planet is real and threatening. “The crises arising from global warming are man-made. So we have to do everything humanly possible to meet this challenge to humanity,’’ Merkel said. According to the German Chancellor, the younger generation, people’s “children and grandchildren’’ will have to live with the consequences of climate change if politicians do not act. She promised to use “all her strength’’ to ensure Germany “makes its contribution ecologically, economically and socially to getting climate change under control.’’ The German parliament has passed a wide-ranging climate package, which includes reform plans to reduce rail prices and increase taxes on air travel. Merkel referred to the policies, which are set to take effect on Jan. 1, after months of wrangling, as a necessary framework for her government’s efforts to tackle climate change.
