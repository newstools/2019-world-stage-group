President Muhammadu Buhari urged the  Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)  to ensure safety of materials already distributed for the elections. Buhari who  stated this  in a statement issued on Saturday following the postponement of the general elections by INEC, said he was disappointed that despite the long notice given and our preparations both locally and internationally, INEC  postponed the Presidential and National Assembly elections within hours of its commencement. “Many Nigerians have traveled to various locations to exercise their right to vote, and international observers are gathered. “INEC themselves have given assurances, day after day and almost hour after hour that they are in complete readiness for the elections.  We and all our citizens believed them. “This administration has ensured that we do not interfere in any way with the work of INEC except to ensure that all funds were released to the commission. “We now urge INEC to ensure not only that materials already distributed are safe and do not get into wrong hands, but that everything is done to avoid the lapses that resulted in this unfortunate postponement, and ensure a free and fair election on the rescheduled dates,” Buhari stated.
