As Nigerians prepare for the 2019 general elections, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Osun has issued a stern warning to corps members to remain apolitical and avoid desperate politicians during the polls. The State Coordinator of NYSC in Osun State, Mr Emmanuel Attah  gave the warning on Tuesday, during his sensitisation visit to local governments in the state. The  visit was to sensitise serving corps members on what is expected of them during the elections. “Corps members are not expected to fraternise with politicians or allow themselves to be used by politicians for their selfish aims and ambitions. “The NYSC is apolitical. We do not belong to any political party, and so, corps members, as children of the scheme, are expected to be apolitical and neutral during elections. “You (corps members) are to work with INEC as neutral agents to give credibility to the election, just like your predecessors have done in time past. “You must uphold the standard of the scheme by diligently and credibly discharging the roles given to you during the elections, and must not hobnob with politicians or their agents. “Ensure to protect your name, the name of your family and the NYSC. “Remember, anybody caught being used by politicians to truncate or disrupt the credibility of the election would be dealt with according to the electoral Act and the law,” he said.
