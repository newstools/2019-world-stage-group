The Director-General (D-G), NYSC , Maj.-Gen. Suleiman Kazaure has called on security agencies to ensure safety of corps members during the 2019 general elections. Kazaure made the request during his separate courtesy visits to the heads of the two security agencies in Port Harcourt on Thursday.
He commended the army and the Police Command in Rivers for the support they had been giving to the NYSC in the state.
According to Kazaure, the corps members are national assets on national assignment and needed to be protected.
”As you know, the corps members will participate in the forthcoming election as ad-hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
”You know that we lost a corps member during the 2015 election in Rivers, so, I need your support for them to be well protected in carrying out that critical assignment,” he said.
In his response, The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Usman Belel, assured the NYSC DG that it was mandatory for the police to protect lives and property.
”It is mandatory for the police to protect INEC materials and staff members, especially NYSC members. We will do everything possible to protect them in partnership with sister security agencies.
”So, I assure you that we will do everything within our reach to protect the young Nigerians as they embark on the 2019 electoral assignment,” he said.
