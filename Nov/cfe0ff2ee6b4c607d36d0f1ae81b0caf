Caglar Soyuncu’s goal and a late effort by Jamie Vardy earned Leicester City a 2-0 win at Crystal Palace to move them back into third place in the Premier League on Sunday. Turkish centre back Soyuncu broke the deadlock at Selhurst Park when he headed home James Maddison’s 57th-minute corner for his first Leicester goal.Vardy fired in his 10th league goal of the season late on to seal the points and a third successive win for Leicester. After last week’s runaway 9-0 thrashing of Southampton, Leicester produced a controlled performance to move to 23 points from 11 games, two points behind Manchester City. Palace, who could have gone fifth with a win, struggled to create clear chances and remained in ninth place.
