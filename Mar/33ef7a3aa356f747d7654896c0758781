WorldStage NewsOnline—-The Benue State Governor, Gov. Samuel Ortom has denied plan to compromise personnel of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Mr Tahav Agerzua, his Special Adviser on Media and ICT made this known in a statement on Monday in Makurdi. He was reacting to the allegation by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state that Ortom had allocated large amounts of money to INEC staff, with the intent to compromise them. “These unfounded allegations being circulated in the media are surely the last kicks of a dying horse. “The results of the Feb. 23, Presidential and National Assembly polls indicate that the party (Peoples Democratic Party) is the preferred choice of the Benue people. “Aside that, the PDP won all the three Senatorial seats, clear majority in the House of Representatives; and the party also recorded the highest votes for the Presidential candidate. “Ortom, who has grassroots support, need not compromise INEC staff to get votes through the backdoor. “The people are poised to once again vote for him massively like they did in 2015, without any undue influence on the electoral umpire. “Moreover, if Ortom has the amount of money mentioned in one of the reports published in the Nation newspaper of Monday, March 4, 2019, he would channel it towards a worthy cause rather than for illegal purposes,” he said.
