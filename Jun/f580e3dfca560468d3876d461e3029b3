He stated that Alogba would be in acting capacity, pending the recommendation of the National Judicial Council and subsequent confirmation by the state House of Assembly. According to him, the appointment followed the need to prevent a vacuum in the state judiciary, given the imminent retirement of the present Chief Judge, Justice Opeyemi Oke.

Prior to his appointment, Justice Alogba was the most senior of the 58 honourable justices in the state judiciary next to the out-going chief judge.
