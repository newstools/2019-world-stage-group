The government of  Anambra State through the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) has distributed relief materials to victims of a collapsed building in Onitsha, the commercial nerve centre of the state. The exercise was carried out at Nkisi Aroli in Onitsha North Local Government Area of the state. The Executive Director of the agency, Mr Cyril Agupugo, who distributed the materials, said that the exercise followed Gov. Willie Obiano’s directive to the agency to distribute relief materials to the victims. “The gesture is to ensure that we give succour to victims of the recently collapsed building as a result of the erosion, which we recorded here recently. “The materials might not totally replace all that you lost, but it is a mere relief to show that the state government and appropriate authorities are aware of the ugly situation you are in,’’ Agupugo said. He asked the affected victims to use the materials well, pending when other aids would be provided to them. The SEMA boss advised the victims to ensure proper documentation and equitable sharing of the items, which included mattresses, blankets and insecticide treated mosquito nets. Mr Douglas Nwachukwu, representing Onitsha North 1 Constituency in the state House of Assembly, commended Obiano for coming to the aid of the victims. Nwachukwu announced that work would commence at the erosion site once the rain subsided to prevent a recurrence of the disaster. He said that the state Ministry of Environment, Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project and other relevant parastatals involved in erosion management had started comprehensive assessment of the cause of the disaster. “The incident is a natural disaster, which can happen anywhere, so you should not blame God, but thank him that no live was lost. “I will urge you not to allow children go towards the erosion site to play games or for any other activity and assist government team that will be deployed to the site soon,’’ he said.
