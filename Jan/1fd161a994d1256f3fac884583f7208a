The major opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  has called on the National Assembly to immediately reconvene and proceed with legislative actions against  President Muhammadu Buhari over  the illegal suspension of Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen. The PDP in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Friday in Abuja, said that the PDP rejected in its entirety, the attempts to foist an illegal Chief Justice on the nation while the substantive CJN, Justice Walter Onnoghen remains in office. President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday suspended Onnoghen, pending the completion of his trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) and sworn in Justice Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed, from Bauchi State, as the acting CJN. According to the president, the suspension was as result of the ongoing trial of Onnoghen by the CCT and subsequent order of the tribunal directing him to suspend him, pending the completion of his trial. Ologbondiyan who is also the Director, Media and Publicity, PDP Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) said that the PDP firmly held that such impunity could not stand, as Nigeria is a nation governed by law. “There can be no two Chief Justices of Nigeria. Our constitution is clear on how a Chief Justice is appointed and removed,  as such does not lie on the prerogative of the President. “As such, we urge all Nigerians and the international community to recognize only Onnoghen as the Chief Justice of Nigeria. Ologbondiyan invited the international community and particularly the United States and the United Kingdom to note that the action was an assault on the judiciary geared towards subverting the 2019 general elections. “Nigeria is a democratic state governed by the constitution and the law and Nigerians will never allow anybody to appropriate rulership to himself outside the dictates of the law,” Ologbondiyan said.
