As part of its youth
empowerment and socio-economic drive, Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, a member of
the Standard Bank Group, recently graduated the 16thbatch of Graduate
Trainees. Stanbic IBTC’s Graduate
Trainee programme is a scheme which recruits talented young Nigerians, who are
either straight out of school or have minimal work experience. They are then
trained on the rudiments of banking with the aim of molding them into future
financial leaders. At the end of their stewardship, they are formally absorbed
into the Stanbic IBTC workforce. Yinka Sanni, Chief
Executive, Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC stated that the company’s Graduate Trainee
programme is a platform for providing career opportunities for young Nigerians. He said: “One of the
highpoints of my stewardship at the helm of Stanbic IBTC is the formal recruitment
and  induction of our graduate trainees every
year. It’s an activity I look forward to annually because it is an opportunity
to employ Nigerians who are young, bright and ready to contribute their quota
to the development of our organization and Nigeria as a country.” The Stanbic IBTC Chief
Executive urged the graduate trainees to brace up to the challenges of being
employed in the organization. Mr. Sanni added: “Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC is a financial services
group of eleven direct andindirect subsidiaries, many of whom are
leaders in their sectors. Our Graduate Trainees
will be formally joining our organization which currently employs about 4,000
Nigerians. I have no doubt that they must have experienced the Stanbic IBTC
work culture, and are looking forward to taking on greater challenges.” The Stanbic IBTC
Graduate Trainees have the opportunity of acquiring a broad range of experience in Nigeria’s financial sector
due to Stanbic IBTC’s status as a full-service financial services organization. Sanni further urged them
to imbibe the values of integrity, teamwork, mutual respect and excellence in service
delivery, while discharging their duties.
