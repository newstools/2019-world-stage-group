WorldStage NewsOnline—- Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged more labour leaders to join politics to bring about change in the country. He also said he did not join politics to be changed by the way things are done by politicians. The former Edo State governor, who spoke at a reception organised by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) for the visiting Director General of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Guy Ryder, said he was of the view that diplomacy would not address the challenges facing the country, adding that only an aggressive engagement can force those benefiting from the status quo to change in a way that will make the country better. Oshiomhole said he believes that more labour leaders should join government so that together they can force a change in the way things are done in the country. Oshiomhole said “Whatever I am doing today, my style and choice of what I do and what I abstain from doing, I owe to Labour. “If you read Nigerian media, there is this saying that as national chairman of a governing party, I am not supposed to be combative, and I said that I am even more convinced now about the need for combat. “If this country is going to change and deliver to the poor, deliver decent jobs, we need not diplomacy but aggressive engagement to force those who are benefiting from the status quo to change and in such a way that will make the country to work for people who live on their wages. “Some people said to me that I am too combative, and I said to them that I was not coming to copy their method but coming to impose my method; to change the system and not for the system to change me. “I refuse to be changed by the system. My hope is that with more comrades coming in, we will work together to change the system for a better future,” he said.
