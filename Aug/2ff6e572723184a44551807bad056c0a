Mr Christian Iheanjumbu, a structural engineer, has said that a decentralised housing scheme would address the housing deficit in Nigeria. Iheanjumbu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Thursday in Abuja that the scheme would also help Nigerians seeking to own houses to achieve that dream at an affordable cost. “Every Nigerian seems to want to live in the urban centres so as to have a sense of “belonging”; the cost of doing so has continued to rise, but we do not appear willing to accept the reality that the city does not have enough space for everyone. “When you look at the geographical distribution of our population, the concentration is too heavy in the urban areas while the figure is sparse in the rural settlements where a vast expanse of land is empty. “There has to be an expansion strategy so as to maximise the available land and minimise the high cost of living in the urban areas,” he said. The expert urged governments at all levels and other land developers to pay attention to the satellite towns outside the city centres where cheaper houses could be built and offered at affordable prices. “A house in Maitama or Asokoro area of Abuja cannot be the same as houses in Mararaba in terms of cost. People should be encouraged to live in the satellite towns where the cost of living is conducive and cheaper. “People should be encouraged to try and live within their means. They should be encouraged to  live in the rural areas. Government should encourage this by developing the satellite towns. “If government makes efforts to provide infrastructure, especially good roads and drainage system in rural areas, citizens will not be running to the city centres to live,” he said.
