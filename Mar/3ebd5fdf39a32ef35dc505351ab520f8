WorldStage Newsonline—-Following reports of irregularities in some parts of Bayelsa state during the Saturday’s elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Tuesday announced that it would conduct a supplementary election in the three constituencies that elections into state assembly were declared inconclusive. Mr Wilfred Ifogah, INEC Head of Department, Voter Education and Publicity, who announced this in Yenagoa, listed the constituencies as Ogbia Constituency 11, Brass 1 and Southern-Ijaw IV. Of the 24 seats in the Bayelsa House of Assembly, 21 have been fully declared; the People Democratic Party (PDP) won 17, while the All Progressive Congress (APC) claimed 4. Ifogah explained that the reason for declaring three constituencies inconclusive was due to failure to follow INEC regulations and guidelines for the conduct of the 2019 general elections. Ifogah said that the commission would inform stakeholders of the new date to conduct the supplementary election.
