WorldStage Newsonline— As part of efforts to ensure free and fair elections, the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Kogi State Command has ordered those in possession of illegal arms and other dangerous weapons to surrender them immediately. A statement issued in Lokoka on Thursday said that the arms and weapons should be submitted to the nearest police station or through traditional rulers in various communities. The statement signed by the command’s spokesman, DSP William Aya, said that violators of this order will have themselves to blame. “In view of this, anyone found engaging in an act capable of disrupting the electoral process will be arrested and made to face the full wrath of the law,” the statement said. According to him, the command is in synergy with other security agencies to ensure peaceful conduct of the rescheduled elections. The command, then, asked political thugs to leave the state immediately, saying that it was determined to deal decisively with any trouble maker before, during and after the elections.
