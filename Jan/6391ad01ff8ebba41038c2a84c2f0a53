Former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan on Tuesday joined other past leaders to attend the National Council of State presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari with Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in Abuja. The meeting is being attended by the Senate President Bukola Saraki, 36 State Governors and Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in attendance.
Others attending the meeting are  Abdulsalami Abubakar and the former Head of the Interim Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan, three former Chief Justices of Nigeria, namely; Muhammadu Uwais, Alfa Belgore and Mahmud Mohammed.
Former military President Ibrahim Babangida and Gen. Yakubu Gowon were however absent at the meeting which started at about 11.05a.m.
Former president Obasanjo, who released a letter on Sunday, alleging plans by Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to rig the 2019 general elections, was asked by President Buhari to offer the opening prayer for the meeting.
The meeting would deliberate on national issues, including the forthcoming general elections and possible endorsement of the appointment of the Acting Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu.
It was also learnt that the leadership of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), led by its Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, would brief the Council on its level of preparation for the upcoming polls.
The Federal Government had on Monday revealed that it was in possession of credible intelligence confirming that opposition politicians were orchestrating widespread violence to truncate the general elections.
The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the allegation at a world press conference in Abuja.
“As you are aware, Nigeria goes to the polls just 27 days from now.
“However, the Federal Government is in possession of credible intelligence to the effect that widespread violence being orchestrated by the opposition is threatening the 2019 general elections,’’ he said.
