WorldStage Newsonline—- In a bid to ensure that Nigeians have  experiences of the new railway system, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says it has so far transported no fewer than 2,500 passengers free of charge on the Lagos-Abeokuta route with the new Standard Gauge line. Mr Jerry Oche, the Lagos Regional District Manager of the corporation, said this in an interview on Wednesday. Recall that the corporation had, on Feb. 11, commenced free movement of passengers on the route, with the new standard gauge line. Oche said that the train had the capacity of transporting 130 passengers on a trip from Lagos to Abeokuta, and was transporting some 260 passengers to and from Abeokuta daily. “About 2,500 passengers have been transported free from Lagos to Abeokuta for now. “We are still going to increase the coaches to accommodate and allow many more people to enjoy the services,’’ he said. The district manager said passengers kept increasing daily, as the service and operations was generating a lot of publicity and awareness. “People keep coming to enjoy the free service while others working at the outskirts of both Lagos and Ogun States like Itori, Ewekoro, Papalanto and other communities enjoy the service,’’ he added.
