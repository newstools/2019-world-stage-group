WorldStage NewsOnline—-The Federal Government  has reaffirmed its commitment  to reduce the number of out of school children  in the country. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed who stated this at a two-day Media Dialogue Programme on Cash Transfers organised by the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) in Birnin Kebbi on Monday called for massive campaign among stakeholders for enrolment, retention and completion of girls education. Mohammed, represented by Mrs Uche Chuta, Assistant Director, Child Right Information Bureau (CRIB) and Advocacy Unit in the ministry, said the Federal Government had introduced various child development policies including the school feeding programme to increase enrolment. The minister noted that the issue of girls’ education was a major concern in most developing countries, and hence, must be addressed for national development. According to him, barriers of girls education in Nigeria, particularly in the northern parts, have been identified to include a wide range of causes and not limited to poverty, early marriage, illiteracy and teenage pregnancy. “It is no gainsaying the fact that girls’ education is a major issue of concern in most developing countries of the world today particularly in Sub Saharan Africa, where a large number of young girls do not attend school. “It is however more worrisome that Nigeria is counted to be among the West African countries that have the highest number of girls that are of school age and are not in school,’’ he said.
