Alhaji Mustapha Bukar, Yobe Coordinator of the coalition, declared the position of his group in an interview  in Damaturu. According to the group, the leadership choice of the party for the 9th Assembly should be the choice of all the senators-elect. The coalition said the senate leader had unequal qualities and high commitment to good governance more than any of the names mentioned eyeing the senate presidency. It said that All Progressives Congress (APC) and the presidency must indicate strong interest in the leadership of the National Assembly to avoid the misfortunes of the eighth Assembly, which was characterized by personality conflicts. “At a time when the Senate leadership was fighting the presidency and delaying passage of budget, Sen. Lawan had been consistent and showed a lot of concern for the interests of Nigerians. “We do not have any more time to waste on unwarranted confrontations and controversies as recorded in the last four years.
