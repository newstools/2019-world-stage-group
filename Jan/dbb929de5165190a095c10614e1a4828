The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has rejected the withdrawal of Dr Obiageli Ezekwesili, the Presidential Candidate of Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) from the Feb. 16 presidential election. The Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, Mr Rotimi Oyekanmi, on Thursday in Abuja said in reaction to Ezekwesili’s  declaration that it was late for any candidate to withdraw from the race. “It is impossible for any presidential candidate to withdraw from the race now. “According to the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2019 General Elections, the last day for withdrawal by candidates or replacement of withdrawn candidates by political parties was Nov. 17, 2018 for Presidential and National Assembly Elections. “Therefore, the deadline for Ezekwesili or any candidate in that category to withdraw or be replaced has passed,” Oyekanmi said. Ezekwesili on Thursday morning announced her withdrawal from the race.
