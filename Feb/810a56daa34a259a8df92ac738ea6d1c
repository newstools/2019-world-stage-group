WorldStage NewsOnline—-The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Nasarawa State, Mr Labaran Maku urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to investigate the cancelation of more than 150, 000 votes from the Presidential and National Assembly Election in the state. Maku, the Gubernatorial Candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) made the call in an interview with Newsmen on Wednesday in Lafia. He said in Nasarawa State, just like in the 2015 General Elections, recorded the highest number of overall cancelled votes. He wondered why there was over-voting since voters were only allowed to vote if they were accredited with the card reader. “The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has colluded with the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government in the state to cancel votes in areas they lost in order to give them advantage. “If there was no collusion between them, then INEC should investigate all Presiding Officers with records of over voting with a view to persecuting them for electoral crimes,” Maku added. The former minister of information alleged that both INEC and the security agencies were not neutral at all in the just concluded elections. “The security agencies were supposed to be the ones protecting the votes and ensuring that only the true winners were announced. “Nobody is supposed to raise a private army to protect his or her votes because that is the duty of the security agencies,” Maku said.
