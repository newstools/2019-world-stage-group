Adeshina said that apart from household consumption, the government was also moving to increase LPG usage in areas such as agriculture, transportation and manufacturing According to him, this will enable Nigeria to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by about 20 per cent and create about 450,000 direct jobs.
