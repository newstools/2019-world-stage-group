Lawmakers at the Nasarawa State House of Assembly says the House will enact a law to allow for direct deduction of pension funds from the local governments’ allocation. This is to ensure prompt payment of pensions to local government pensioners in the state. Alhaji Mohammed Alkali, the Chairman of Nasarawa State House of Assembly Committee on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, disclosed this on Friday when the body paid an oversight visit to the State Pension Board in Lafia. Alkali, who frowned at non prompt remittance of pension funds by some local government chairmen, said that the House would not hesitate to direct for central deduction of the pension funds to enable pensioners to get their pensions when salaries were being paid to civil servants. ” We want to ensure that local government pensioners received 100 per cent of their pensions in order to improve on their standard of living and that of their family members. “As almost all of them are depending on their monthly pensions for their livelihood . ” It is in view of this that the House will enact a law for direct deduction of pension funds from the local government allocation if some chairmen who are delaying in remitting pension funds did not stop the act, ” he said. The chairman, while commending the Director-General of the board, Alhaji Sani Oseze, for his efforts so far, however, advised him to sanitise the local government pension system to enable pensioners to enjoy 100 percent of their pensions.
