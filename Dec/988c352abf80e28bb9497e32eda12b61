Sen. David Mark,  former President of the Senate has urged Nigerians to renew their commitment to collective prosperity and development by contributing positively to nation building. Mark, in his New Year message issued by his media aide, Paul Mumeh, on Tuesday, also implored Nigerians to reignite the indomitable spirit they are known for in order to overcome the current  socio-economic and security challenges facing some parts of the country. He urged governments at all levels to make conscious and deliberate efforts toward addressing the issues of unemployment as well as the unabating insecurity in the country. He acknowledged the resilience and perseverance of Nigerians over the years and urged them not to be deterred or despair by the prevailing situation but enter the New Year with renewed hope and vigour. The former senate president also urged citizens to live in harmony with one another in spite of ethnic or religious differences. “We are all one under one God. We should be our brothers’ keeper at all times,”he said.
