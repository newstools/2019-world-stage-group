The Venezuelan Government and opposition will continue talks mediated by Norway, the government in Oslo said on Friday. The goal is to work continuously and “as fast as possible,’’ according to the statement issued. “We stress the need for the parties to be as cautious as possible in their comments and statements related to the process,’’ the Norwegian government said. It added that it was important “to give the parties the necessary space to move forward in a constructive atmosphere and that the confidentiality of the process is respected by all.’’ “We continue the dialogue and confirm that we shall fully respect the established guidelines. “We urge everyone to look after this negotiating effort between Venezuelans,’’ the country’s Information Minister, Jorge Rodriguez, tweeted. President Nicolas Maduro’s government and the opposition, headed by Juan Guaido, have been holding talks in Barbados this month. Maduro, who has presided over a massive economic crisis, won a second term in a disputed election held in 2018. Guaido declared himself interim president in January and won the support of dozens of countries for his campaign to oust Maduro. The government and opposition representatives held a previous round of talks in Oslo in May. At the time, the opposition showed little interest in negotiating with the government, stressing that the only solution was for Maduro to resign and fresh elections to be held.
