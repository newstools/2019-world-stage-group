South Korean President, Moon Jae-In, has called for cooperation with Japan to solve the countries’ trade dispute. Moon made the call on Thursday in a speech marking South Korea’s Liberation Day, when occupying Japanese forces were pushed out of the country at the end of World War II. ‘’Better late than never; if Japan chooses the path of dialogue and cooperation, we will gladly join hands. “We will strive with Japan to create an East Asia that engages in fair trade and cooperation,’’ Moon said. While criticising Japan for removing South Korea from a white list of trusted trading partners, the South Korean leader noted that such an action should not damage the two countries’ good relations.
