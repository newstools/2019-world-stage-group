The Federal Government has handed over 19 silos located in 18 states and the Federal Capital Territory to six concessionaires across the country. Chief Audu Ogbeh, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, handing over the silos in Abuja on Tuesday, charged the concessionaires to manage the silos effectively as  there were national assets. Ogbeh advised the concessionaires to spray the silos with afla-safe to avoid aflatoxin infestation and ensure the purchase of grains bagged in only jute bags that would help their grains not to have more than five per cent moisture content before storage. The minister said that the Federal Government would retain six of the silos for strategic reasons. “When we came in, this concession process was partially ready but we congratulate ourselves and the ministry for refusing to interfere with it. “The country has 33 silos but not all are ready, government is keeping six and the rest are going to you for management. “Look after them well, take care of them manage them well because they are national assets. We need the silos because our population is growing,’’ Ogbeh advised.
