WorldStage NewsOnline—- Following the postponement of the general elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Federal Government has approved visa fee waiver for accredited observers and monitors of the nation’s upcoming polls. Comptroller-General Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Mr Muhammad Babandede, announced this in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday. He said that the waiver was sequel to the re-scheduling of the general elections to Saturday for Presidential and National Assembly, from Feb. 16, and March 9 for Governorship and House of Assembly, from March 2. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) gave logistics and operational problems as reasons for postponing the polls.

He urged all affected individuals and organisations wishing to extend their stay or travel back to their countries and return for the next elections to visit NIS Visa Desk at INEC Headquarters. “The desk officers will attend to those requiring extension of their visas issued Gratis (No Fee Charge).
