WorldStage Newsonline– National President of Harmonised Traders Union, Dr. Bature AbdulAziz, has advised northerners to ask Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Reverend Mathew Hasan Kukah, how he wants to train one million Almajiri children as he proposed rather than completely reject the proposal. AbdulAziz, who described the move by the bishop to train the Almajiris as suspicious, said he believed that the issue arose following the negligence and disregard for the well being of Almajiri children by the Ullamas, elites and all well to do of northern extraction. He said: “The Almajiris system has suffered heavy criticisms and attacks by many Nigerians and yet no concrete solution had been proffered to solve the problems. “Now that an outsider feels concerned and want to support the Almajiris, we should not in totality condemn him, but we should rather ask him to forward his ideas to us and share with us how he will do it with our active participation.” He was worried that northern elites, political leaders and Ullamas had over time failed to come up with a means on how the menace of Almajiranci could be curtailed or transformed to a modern way of education.
