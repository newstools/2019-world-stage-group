WorldStage NewsOnline—- The All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and all relevant security agencies to  ensure free, peaceful and fair  supplementary elections on Saturday in the affected states as fixed by the electoral body. Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja expressed confidence that APC would come out strong at the polls. He, however, added that the decision of INEC to hold supplementary elections, in Rivers, Sokoto, Kano, Plateau and Benue states was illegal. “As a party, the APC is very confident of victory in the forthcoming supplementary elections; our commitment to free and fair elections in the country remains resolute. “We urge INEC to ensure that all loopholes that led to rigging, vote buying and intimidation of voters by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are blocked. “We equally urge INEC and relevant security agencies to ensure that the supplementary election is free, peaceful and fair compared to the last inconclusive governorship election,” he said. This, Issa-Onilu said, was especially in the state which was characterised by many irregularities including voter-intimidation, stressing that no political ambition was worth the life of any voters. He further noted that after the March 9 governorship elections across the country, polls in affected states were declared inconclusive by the INEC. According to him, the electoral process was also suspended in Rivers State in a very fraudulent circumstance.
