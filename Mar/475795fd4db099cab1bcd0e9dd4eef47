WorldStage NewsOnline—-The Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Sunday denied rumour of quitting politics and dumping the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He made the statement through his Media Adviser,  Mr Ikechukwu Eze, in reaction to a report by an online publication which claimed that the ex-president had resigned from PDP and quit politics. Eze’s statement described the news as fake, saying that it was a “calculated attempt to rubbish the elder statesman”. “The PDP gave Jonathan the platform to serve as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President and eventually President of Nigeria. Jonathan has no reason at this time to resign his membership of the platform. “Those who derive pleasure in spreading fake information had better occupy themselves with more productive endeavours that are obviously more  relevant to nation building.
