A Gambian   reporter,  Mr Sise Sawaneh, says the postponement might affect the attitude of electorate towards voting on the re-scheduled dates. Sawaneh who stated this in an interview in Abuja expressed concern over the postponement of the general elections  saying the action would affect lives, movement and businesses. Sawaneh, who is in Nigeria to cover the general elections,  said it was unfortunate the elections didn’t hold. He further expressed concerns that the postponement might affect the attitude of electorate towards voting on the re-scheduled dates. “It’s unfortunate we did not see this coming. “I am concerned with the citizens who have been affected by this, their lives, businesses, movement and activities, and to an extent it might affect their attitude towards voting on the rescheduled date as well. “Usually elections like this might encounter logistic challenges that need to be addressed, but it calls for careful management so as not to make the citizens feel bad and take apathy. “For me, I am still here, though it has extra budgetary implications, but I will manage to do my job of reporting till the end.
