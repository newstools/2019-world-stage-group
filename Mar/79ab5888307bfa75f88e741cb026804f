WorldStge NewsOnline—-No fewer than 300 candidates have been shortlisted   for recruitment by  the Nigerian Prisons Service (NPS) in Lagos. Lagos State Controller, NPS,  Mr Tunde Ladipo  made the disclosure in an interview on Friday in Lagos, adding that the exercise would take place from Monday March 18 to Saturday March 23.. According to him, preparations for the successful conduct of the exercise which will include both written and oral tests, have been concluded. “We are set to conduct the 2018 recruitment for Nigerian Prisons. “Over 300 shortlisted applicants have been notified and invited for the interview from Monday, March 18, to Saturday, March 23. “The interview is for candidates for the Superintendent cadre to the Assistant Superintendent (ASP) and others. “We must warn, that those who are not invited for the interview are not to come to the venue of the exercise for security reasons. “We have put adequate security measures in place to ensure a hitch-free conduct of the exercise just as we are also enjoining the candidates to comport themselves throughout the period,” Ladipo said. The prisons boss noted that the essence of the exercise was to boost manpower of the service and inject new blood. According to him, there is a shortfall of manpower as a result of retirement of staff. He noted that to this end, there was a need to fill the existing gap created by the retirement of old staff and bring in new ones that would further boost the security of the various prisons. “For instance here in Lagos, we have five prisons. We also have what we call the Cottage, a form of industry, which houses our printing section, welding and tailoring. “We also have the poultry, fish pond and the dog section, which we call the Canine and the Arms Squad. “The dogs are trained there as they also assist in carrying out security tasks too,” he said.
