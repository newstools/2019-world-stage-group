Two ex-officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Christian Nwosu and Tijani Bashir have been convicted  for collecting N264.8 million from the former Minister of Petroleum  Resources,  Diezani Alison-Madueke. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)  said that the convicts accepted  money  from a former Minister of Petroleum Resources,  Diezani Alison-Madueke, in the build up to the 2015 general elections. Justice Mohammed Idris who has been elevated to the Court of Appeal,  but concluded the case on a fiat, convicted  the ex-officials. He, however, adjourned  sentencing  of the convicts until Friday  to enable Nwosu to appear in court. EFCC prosecuted the ex-officials and one Yisa Adedoyin, who had earlier been convicted by the court after he pleaded guilty to the charge. The EFCC  said that the convicts accepted  money  from a former Minister of Petroleum Resources,  Diezani Alison-Madueke, in the build up to the 2015 general elections. The anti-graft agency said that the convicts ought to know that the money  formed part of the proceeds of an unlawful act.
