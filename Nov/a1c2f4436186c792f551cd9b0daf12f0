The African Development Bank’s African Financial Markets Initiative (AFMI) will be hosting its 8th annual workshop on local currency bonds and capital markets development from 19th to 21st November 2019 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. AFMI’s goal is to foster the development and long-term resilience of debt markets in Africa by strengthening the domestic bond market and investing in local currency-denominated instruments. Its specific objectives are: (i) to enable governments to improve the terms at which they borrow in domestic financial markets, thus reducing their dependence on foreign currency debt; (ii) to increase financing options available to businesses; (iii) to act as a catalyst for the development and stability of financial markets, and for regional financial market integration; and (iv) to improve the availability and transparency of African fixed income data. The event will bring together more than 100 financial sector players including central bank governors, Ministries of Finance, commercial bank chief executives, pension funds, as well as liaison officers covering the debt market, pensions, insurance and the senior management of the African Development Bank.
