Justice Mojisola Dada of the Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos has fixed January 14, 2020 for ruling on the bail application filed by an alleged fraudster, Jean Codo, in a case of stealing to the tune of €29million. Codo was arraigned alongside his company,  Transport and Port Management Systems Limited, TPMS,  by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on a seven-count charge bordering on stealing to the tune of €29million on Friday, December 13, 2019. One of the counts reads: “That you, Jean Codo and TPMS Transport and Port Management Systems Ltd, sometime in 2010 in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, conspired to commit felony, to wit; stealing of about €29,000,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Euros), property of the Federal Government of Nigeria.” He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. At today’s sitting, Codo’s lawyer, Ajibola Ariba, filed a bail application and pleaded with the court to admit his client to bail on the grounds that he is battling health challenges. In response, the prosecution counsel, S.I. Suleiman, told that court that a counter-affidavit opposing the release of the defendant to bail had been filed and served on the defence Suleiman, who described the defendant as a flight risk, further stated that no medical report had been shown to the court regarding the health of the defendant to “persuade or convince the court to admitting him to bail”. He, therefore, urged the court not to grant the defendant bail. Justice Dada adjourned the case till January 24, 2020 for ruling on the bail application.
