The Federal Government has donated relief materials worth millions of naira to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPS) in five Local Government Areas in Zamfara.
The Federal Commissioner, National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons, Hajiya Sadiya Farouk, presented the items to the victims in Birnin-Magaji, Maradun, Shinkafi, Tsafe and Zurmi towns on Saturday.
The  items comprised bags of assorted grains, sugar, bedding materials, toiletries, milk, cosmetics among others.
Farouk said the gesture was aimed at supporting the IDPs and reducing their suffering.
“This is part of the federal government’s commitment under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to show care and concern to our sisters, brothers who find themselves in this unwanted situation,” she said.
She described the dwindling security challenges in the state as worrisome and unfortunate.
“This is a very unfortunate situation, we are interested in giving relief to victims of disasters; we are hoping this problem will end very soon.
“We have so far provided relief materials to seven local government areas, our aim is to provide support to all IDPs in the state,” Farouk said.
