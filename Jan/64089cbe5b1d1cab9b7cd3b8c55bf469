A Federal High Court in Kano on Wednesday nullified the ticket of Kano Municipal Federal Constituency candidate, Sha’aban Sharada, in the forthcoming general elections. Sharada, a Personal Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Broadcast Media, contested for Federal House of Representatives primary election under the All Progressives Congress (APC) held on Oct. 4, 2018. The Presiding Judge, Justice Sa’adatu Ibrahim,while giving her ruling on the case, said the primary election that produced Sha’aban Sharada was faulty. According to her, Mukhtar Ishaq Yakasai was the authentic candidate because when the date was set for primary elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was not aware of any candidate aside from Mukhtar Ishaq-Yakasai. “As such, the court considered the result of the election was the authentic because Ishaq won the election,” the Judge said. She, therefore, directed the All Progressives Congress (APC) to immediately submit the name of Mukhtar Ishaq Yakasai to the Independent National Electoral Commission for consideration and other necessary actions. The Judge also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to recognise Mukhtar Ishaq Yakasai as the duly elected APC candidate of the Kano Municipal Federal Constituency for the polls. Speaking to newsmen shortly after the judgement, counsel to the complainant, Mr M. M Duru, expressed satisfaction with the judgement saying his client is the authentic candidate. However, counsel to defendant, (Sharada), Jimoh Moshood, declined to comment on the judgement. Yakasai, a former Chairman of Kano Municipal Council, filed the case against Sharada on the ground that he was the person duly elected during the APC primary elections held in October 2018.
