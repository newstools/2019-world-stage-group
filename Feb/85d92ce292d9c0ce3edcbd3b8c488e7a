WorldStage Newsonline– Former Governor of Delta, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, has called for the cancellation of last Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly election in the state, saying  it was marred with irregularities. Uduaghan contested for the Delta South Senatorial District on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC),  and according to the result announced on Tuesday by INEC Returning Officer, Prof. Oladipupo Adesina, Sen. James Manager polled 258,812 votes to defeat Uduaghan, who scored 125,776 votes. Uduaghan  in a statement issued by his Media Assistant, Mr Monoyo Edon, on Tuesday in Warri said, “I wish to state that the election was fraught with a lot of electoral malpractices and ballot stuffing. “It was also crippled with electoral violence in some parts of Burutu, Bomadi, Patani, Warri North and Isoko North Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state. “I have already petitioned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the irregularities during collation and final announcement of result at the Senatorial Collation Centre in Oleh, Isoko South,” he said. Uduaghan, however, appealed to APC supporters and the people of Delta South to remain calm as further directives would be communicated soon. He thanked them for their loyalty throughout the electioneering period.
