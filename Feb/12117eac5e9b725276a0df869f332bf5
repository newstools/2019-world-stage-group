The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Jigawa on Saturday donated relief materials to the victims of 2018 flood disasters in Guri Local Government Area of the state. The materials included 10 bags of maize, 15 bags of Guinea Corn, 20 rolls of fabric, nine bundles of mats and over 300 pieces of buckets, bowls and plates. Alhaji Abdu Magama, the state chairman, National Union of Road Transport Workers, while presenting the materials in Guri on behalf of NLC, urged the council to be fair in distributing same to victims of the disasters “The essence of this donation is just to show our concern, but not to meet the demands of all the affected persons; we do not have that capacity. “Therefore, I am appealing to you to show justice and fairness in distributing these materials,” he said.
