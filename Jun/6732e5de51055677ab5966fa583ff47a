WorldStage Newsonline– The Federal Ministry of Agriculture has said that the Federal Government of Nigeria had made agriculture a pivot for growth and development in response to the need to accelerate economic growth of the country. The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dr Mohammed Umar said on Wednesday in Abuja at the national validation workshop for agricultural Joint Sector Review (JSR), Biennial Review (BR) and second Nigeria Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP 2) reports that to actualise this development agenda, inclusiveness, transparency and accountability were the adopted factors for assessing performance and ensuring progress. “The Federal Government shall sustain the consultative channels of the National Food Security Council, National Agricultural and Rural Development Council, among others. “Government is ready to maintain decision-making platforms that include the Federal Executive Council, National Economic Council and Council of State. “This has become necessary considering the need to address the social, political and economic dimensions of governance, administration and development in the country,’’ he said. Umar said that in Nigeria, agriculture continued to be a stable driver of gross domestic products. He said that this was made possible by exploring the comparative advantage of the crop, fishery and livestock sub-sectors for increased productivity across the respective commodity value chains in the country. “Nigeria’s strategic development plan and the African Union (AU)’s continental agenda is guiding the formulation and implementation of policies, programmes and projects in agriculture. “This is to ensure food security, employment generation and wealth creation in the country,’’ Umar said.
