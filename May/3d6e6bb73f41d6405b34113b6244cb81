The Nigerian Prison Service (NPS), FCT Command  has arrested a visitor to the Kuje Prison, Mr Clement Jacob, for allegedly attempting to smuggle illegal substance into the prison premises. The command’s spokesman, Mr Chukwuedo Humphrey who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday, said the substance was suspected to be sativa cannabis (Indian hemp). Chukwuedo said the substance was concealed in sandals that were to be delivered to Mr Emeka Onyejikacki, an inmate of Kuje Medium Security Prison. He said that the inmate was in prison custody for a case bothering on possession of hard drugs. He said that Jacob was apprehended when he exchanged his sandals with that of the inmate after his session of prison visit. “Inspector Hussain Ibrahim, the officer in charge of the visit area, noticed the quick exchange of footwear and requested for another search after the visiting session was over. “It was during the search that Ibrahim carefully tore open the foot of the sandals thereby exposing the illegal transaction,” he said. The spokesman said that upon interrogation, the suspect pleaded ignorance and claimed that it one Mrs Emeka called him to assist her in paying Onyejikacki a visit. He noted that Jacob said he was instructed to exchange his footwear with the inmate before leaving the premises. Meanwhile, the Controller of Prisons, FCT Command, Mr Mustapha Atta, has commended the alertness of the officer. Atta reminded members of the public and family members of inmates of their responsibility in ensuring that inmates were properly reformed and rehabilitated.
