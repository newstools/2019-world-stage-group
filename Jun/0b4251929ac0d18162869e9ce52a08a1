European Union leaders gathering for talks in Brussels could for the first time make reference to a common target of achieving net carbon neutrality by 2050, a revised draft of their summit conclusions said. “The text calls for work to advance on “the conditions, incentives and the enabling framework to be put in place, in order to determine how to ensure a transition to a climate-neutral EU by 2050. “Any measures must “preserve European competitiveness, be just and socially balanced, take account of member states’ national circumstances and respect their right to decide on their own energy mix,’’ the draft added. It said before being adopted, however, this proposed text is likely to be fiercely debated by EU leaders, as not all 28 member states embrace this goal.
