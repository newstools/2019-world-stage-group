Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has commiserated with the Ekiti State Police Command and the family of the policeman that was killed by armed robbers last Thursday in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. It was an emotion laden visit at the home of late Kamoru Momoh, a CID operatives by Governor Fayemi, who was almost moved to tears sighting the wife and young children of the deceased. He promised the family that government would sponsor the education and other needs of the children. Describing the incident as unfortunate, the Governor assured the family of the police officer of government support especially in the area of collecting Death certificate and carrying out of post mortem of the deceased because they said they don’t have money to do that. Kamoru’s widow, Fatimah broke down in tears uncontrollably on sighting the governor and his team as she kept on shouting that her husband was a very hardworking officer who died in active service. Governor Fayemi promised to ensure that security of lives and properties continues to be his top priorities. He assured the people of the state that his government would remain focused and ensure that the perpetrators are tracked down and prosecuted.
