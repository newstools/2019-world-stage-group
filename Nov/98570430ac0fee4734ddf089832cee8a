The Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola on Monday congratulated Bayelsa State Governor-elect, Chief David Lyon, on his victory in the Nov. 16 Governorship election in the state. The governor’s congratulatory message was contained in a statement made available to newsmen by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Ismail Omipidan, on Monday in Osogbo. Oyetola, who is a member of the Bayelsa State All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Campaign Committee, noted that the victory was a clear indication of Nigerians’ preference for the ruling party. He described Lyon’s victory as a sweet one, saying that with Bayelsa now in kitty of the APC, it had put paid to the long-held sentiment that APC was a party that had no foothold in the South-South. The governor said that lovers of democracy must commend the resilience of the people of Bayelsa in deepening the country’s democracy through their decision to vote the progressive party into power for the first time, since 1999. “On behalf of the people and Government of the State of Osun, I congratulate our President, Muhammadu Buhari, our National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and our National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ’’ Oyetola said. He also congratulated the leadership of the APC and the APC Governorship Campaign Committee under the Chairmanship of the Jigawa State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Badaru for “the sweet and well-deserved victory’’.
