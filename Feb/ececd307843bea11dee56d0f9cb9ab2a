In a bid to unravel the cause of the recent fire incident at the INEC office, which burnt two containers of Smart Card Readers meant for 2019 general elections in Anambra state, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded an independent probe to prevent future occurrence. The state Chairman of PDP, Chief Ndubuisi Nwobu, made the call in an interview on Thursday in Awka. Nwobu said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as an independent body should tell Nigerians all they know about the fire incident. He said the fire could be taken as deliberate arson if INEC did not come up with the true story, adding that it had put the possibility of holding election on Feb. 16 at risk. The PDP chieftain expressed concerns over why the containers that had been serving INEC since 2011 could go up in flames four days to the crucial national elections. “To us as a party, it is pure sabotage, a deliberate act or arson, how can fire catch metal containers and all its content without explanation? “We demand that INEC tells Nigerians all it knows about the fire, let the commission get to the root of the cause of the inferno and punish those responsible,” he said.
