WorldStage NewsOnlineâ€”-The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill to abolish and prohibit discrimination between First Degrees and Higher National Diplomas (HND) in the same profession. The bill was presented by Rep. Mohammed Mongonu (APC -Borno) at the plenary presided over by the Speaker, Mr Yakubu Dogara. The bill which was sponsored by Rep. Ali Isa (Gombe-PDP) and Rep. Edward Pwajok (Plateau-PDP) passed second reading in April, 2017. While leading the debate for the bill to pass second reading, Pwajok said a research he carried out on both certificates, showed that the discrimination had no moral justification. He said that the unfortunate situation would make the international community to look down on the status of educational institutions in the country. The lawmaker said that it was unfortunate that such discrimination existed in a critical sector required for national development, regretting that there was a lot of segregation at employment level. According to him, those with first degree are placed on Grade Level 8, while those with HND are placed on Grade Level 6 or 7. He said that in some organisations, degree holders were paid N100, 000 at entry level, while their counterparts with HND were paid N70, 000.
