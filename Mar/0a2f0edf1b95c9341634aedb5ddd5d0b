Some chieftains  of the  All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo have described Gov. Rochas Okorocha’s suspension by the party’s  National Working Committee(NWC)  as well deserved. Speaking on the development on Saturday, a party chieftain, Dr Jude Agu, said Okorocha had been  engaged in anti party activities in his pursuit to making his son in-law succeed him as governor. Agu said Okorocha would have been suspended long ago to check his bad  influence in the party. He said the NWC of the APC should equally suspend Okorocha’s allies in the party whom he said were also involved in anti party activities. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the  NWC on Friday suspended  Okorocha  for anti party activities. But Okorocha in his reaction to the suspension through his Chief Press Secretary,  Mr Sam Onwuemeodo,  said some APC leaders were after him over 2023 politics. He also said the suspension was meant to stop him from holding a critical position in the senate, adding that the suspension would eventually fail. Mr John Anyanwu, a former commissioner in Imo, said with the suspension of Okorocha, APC had better chances of winning the state’s governorship election. He said if Okorocha was allowed, he would definitely work against the APC candidate in the state.
