We will, of course, support the authorities as required.“We wish to reassure the public and our various stakeholders of our unwavering commitment to safety in all of our operations.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has dismissed the reports that the Helicopter belonged to it or was from the 011 Presidential Air Fleet (011 PAF). The NAF in a statement  stated “that the helicopter that crashed in Kabba does not belong to the NAF or 011 PAF. The owners/operators of the civilian helicopter, Messrs Caverton Helicopters, have already issued a statement on the matter. “In addition, the military Dauphin Helicopter, painted in desert camouflage colour, seen in the video circulating on social media does not belong to the NAF and should not be misrepresented as belonging to the NAF. Accordingly, the general public is advised to disregard such erroneous information and the misleading video. “The NAF joins the Nation in thanking God for sparing the life of our Vice President as well as other passengers and crew members involved in the mishap. We pray for the safety of the Vice President and that all his take-offs will culminate in an equal number of safe landings. “IBIKUNLE DARAMOLAAir CommodoreDirector of Public Relations and InformationNigerian Air Force………………..
