In a bid to ease payment of taxes and revenues by hospitality industries in Kaduna state, the Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service (KDIRS) said on Wednesday that it had developed e-platform. Dr Zaid Abubakar, the Executive Chairman of the agency made this known in Kaduna at a training on hotel management information system organised by KDIRS. Abubakar explained that the training was designed to equip the management, finance and account officers of hospitality industry with the needed skills to access the platform and make payments. He added that the e-platform would enable the industry, including hotels and restaurants pay all taxes and revenues due to the state from the comfort of their offices. According to him, the goal is to improve revenue generation by easing the business of tax payment in the state. “This, in the long run will ease the business environment that will in turn encourage the growth of all businesses in the state. “We are doing all we can to engender voluntary compliance among tax payers in the state and we hope to achieve this through series of stakeholder engagements.’’ The State’s Secretary of Nigeria Hotel Association, Mr Jijiwin Akpovwovwo described the initiative as ‘a welcome development.’ Akpovwovwo said that the association would encourage its members to embrace the e-payment platform, which he said would remove the stress of queuing in banks. “This is commendable, considering that we are in a digital world where every financial transaction, marketing and other service are being conducted online.
