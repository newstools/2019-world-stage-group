WorldStage NewsOnline—A member of House of Representatives, representing Ikeja Federal Constituency, Hon. James Faleke has assured Nigerians of quick amendment of the  Electoral Act  by the 9th National Assembly. Falake who disclosed this on Wednesday in Abuja, said it was imperative that the act was amended to address the hitches encountered during the 2019 General Elections to make way for smooth 2023 polls. The federal lawmaker said that the amendment of the legal framework for the conduct of election was important for the country’s electoral process and its democracy. “The 8th Assembly amendment came late because it was close to the general elections, which made it impossible for the President to ascent to it because it would have created confusion if it was done. “We would have been in crisis by now. So, we expect that this 9th Assembly’s amendment will come as early as possible. We have four years to go, we should be able to do it in the first year,” Faleke said. Commenting on the challenges of the 2019 General Elections, Faleke identified the delay in delivery of voting materials to polling units as one of the major hitches encountered during the polls. He advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to improve on the deployment of electoral materials and logistics in future elections. “We need to look at a way of improving on the deployment of logistics. If materials do not get to polling units on time, people tend to become tired and just go back to their homes. “I saw this as a major issue, and we will prevail on INEC to find a better way of handling it,” he said. Faleke, re-elected for a third time as a federal lawmaker, thanked his constituents for believing in him, saying he would not betray the trust reposed in him.
