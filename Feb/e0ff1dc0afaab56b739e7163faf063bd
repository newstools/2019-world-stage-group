The Federal Government has initiated investigations into the alleged trafficking of over 2,500 kilograms of Pangolin Scales and 600 kilograms of Ivory Tusks seized by the Vietnamese Customs Service‎. The Minister of Environment, Alhaji Suleiman Zarma, disclosed this in a statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday by Mr Saghir el-Mohammed, Director of Press, Federal Ministry of Environment. Zarma also ordered investigations into the alleged trafficking of 8,200 kilograms of Pangolin Scales and 2,000 kilograms of Ivory Tusks seized by the Hong Kong Custom Service. The minister said that the investigation was necessary because illegal wildlife trafficking were alleged to have originated from the Apapa, Seaport, Lagos, Nigeria. Zarma was reacting to media reports on the seized items, which were said to have high market values, especially for the use of the Pangolin scales as medicinal ingredients in parts of Asia, especially China. “‎The Ministry has initiated investigations of the reported illegal trade by communicating officially with the Vietnamese and Hong Kong CITES Management Authority, with a view to furnishing us with the documents that will be forwarded to the Nigerian Customs Service and INTERPOL for further investigations. “It is very unsettling when information is received that the Vietnamese customs made the discovery in concealed containers declared as consigning knocked wood by the Vietnamese company – VIC Thanh Binh Import-Export Company Limited with office address at Lien Hong Commune, Dan Phuong District, Hanoi. “More disturbing is the fact that Nigeria is mentioned as the source in spite of our laudable conservation efforts which informed our leading the war against illegal wildlife trade in the West African Region,’’ he said.
