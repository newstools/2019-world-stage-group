Growth in the West bank and Gaza has to be focused on creating jobs, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday, as she discussed the Trump administration’s 50 billion dollars economic plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace. “One of the really good aspects of the plan … is that it identifies some of the sectors, some of the industrial and economic sectors, that will be conducive to jobs,” said IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. “It cannot be any kind of growth in the West Bank and Gaza, it needs to be job intensive,” she added, citing agriculture, tourism and construction as sectors that “will absorb a lot of labor”.
