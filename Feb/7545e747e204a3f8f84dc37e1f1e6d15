Following the postponement of the general elections to Feb. 23 and March 9, the National leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sen. Bola Tinubu, has urged Nigerians to remain committed to the process. Tinubu made the call in a statement made available to newsmen on Saturday in Lagos by his Media Officer, Mr Tunde Rahman. Presidential and National Assembly elections slated for Feb. 16 were shifted till Feb. 23 by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday, hours to the commencement of the polls. Governorship, state houses of assembly and Federal Capital Territory Area Council polls, earlier fixed for March 2 were also moved to March 9 by INEC due to some challenges. According to Tinubu, there were reports of eager voters rising early to leave their homes to cast their ballots on Saturday only to be told upon arriving at their appointed polling stations that the election had been postponed. He said that this should not have happened for it could well discourage people from coming out when the election takes place. Tinubu, however, urged people who came out and other Nigerians who intended to cast their votes to maintain their commitment and prepare to do so on Feb. 23. “Do not allow this delay to deter you from the expression of your democratic rights. “What you had set your mind to do on February 16, keep your mind and heart on for February 23, ” he said.
