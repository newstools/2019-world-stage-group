WorldStage NewsOnline—-All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to replace the Rivers State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Obo Effanga ahead of the Saturday’s supplementary election in the state. APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu,  said in a statement that the redeployment became necessary to prevent the REC from skewing the forthcoming supplementary elections in favour of the opposition. He added that it was on record that Gov. Wike, through the Rivers State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Obo Effanga, engaged PDP card carrying members as Local Government Area (LGA) Collation Officers in the last poll and was capable of repeating same in forthcoming elections. He recalled that since the suspension of the electoral process in Rivers, Gov. Wike and the State REC, Obo Effanga, had been re-writing and doctoring unit results in Rivers State Government House to favour Wike. Issa-Onilu observed the proactive steps taken by security agents to checkmate a repeat of the 2015 killings and destructions, and that the report of the security saying this should be applauded by all peace loving people. He, however, called on Nigerians and the international community not to be hoodwinked into believing that Nigerian security agencies interfered in the electoral process in Rivers. “It is a misleading narrative being planted in the media to particularly blackmail the military and the Federal Government into pulling out security agents from the state,” he said.
