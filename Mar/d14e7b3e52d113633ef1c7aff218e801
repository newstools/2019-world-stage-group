The
Court of Appeal in Lagos on Friday, March 29, 2019 in a judgement delivered by
Hon. Justice Garuba Lawal, directed that the case between Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG)
and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) over
applicability of NIMASA levies to NLNG be remitted to the Federal High Court
for a rehearing, thereby setting aside the judgment of the lower court in the
matter. NLNG
had filed a case in 2013 at the Federal High Court, Lagos Division against the
Attorney General of the Federation and Global West Vessel Specialists Nigeria
Limited, seeking a judicial determination on, among other things, the legality
or otherwise of certain levies sought to be imposed on NLNG by NIMASA, an
agency of the Federal Government and the consequent blockade of NLNG vessels by
NIMASA and Global West as a result of the dispute. The
Federal High Court gave its decision in October 2017 in favour of NLNG, granting
all the reliefs sought by NLNG in the case. We remain committed to building a better
Nigeria.
