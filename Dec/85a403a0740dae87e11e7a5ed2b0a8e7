market movements and properly manage investment portfolios. Designed using the
market capitalization methodology, the indices are rebalanced on a
semi-annual basis on the first business day in January and in July. The Nigerian bourse began publishing the NSE 30 Index in
February 2009 with index values available from January 1, 2007. On July 1,
2008, the NSE developed five sectoral indices with a base value of 1,000
points, designed to provide investable benchmarks to capture the performance of
specific sectors. The sectoral indices comprise the top fifteen most
capitalized and liquid companies in the Insurance and Consumer Goods sectors;
the top ten most capitalized and liquid companies in the Banking and
Industrial Goods sector; and the top seven most capitalized and liquid
companies in the Oil & Gas sector. The Exchange in collaboration with issuers like
Lotus Capital, Meristem Securities and Afrinvesthave also published co-branded
indices.
