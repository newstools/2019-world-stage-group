WorldStage NewsOnline—- The  Jos Metropolitan Development Board (JMDB), on Sunday lamented that some houses in Bukuru and Jos metropolis were built without toilet facilities. Mr Kefas Yilrwang, the Acting Managing Director of JMDB who disclosed this in Jos said that the absence of such facilities  had led to open defecation and created health  problems in the affected towns. According to him, occupants of such houses simply locate nearby bush or abandoned building structures, to ease themselves. He explained that the cost of renting such houses was normally ‘very cheap,’ as such, tenants still went for them (house) even though they were aware of the absence of toilets. He reminded landlords that any house without adequate toilet facility was an illegal structure and must have been built without supervision by the board. Also commenting on the development, Mr Joshua Nyako,  Director, Environmental Health,  JMDB, said landlords of houses without toilet were first given verbal warning . He said that if another inspection was conducted after one week and no measures were taken, the landlord would then be served abatement notice for 30 days. Nyako further explained that after a given time frame the problem was not addressed, landlords would then be sanctioned according to the provisions of the law.
