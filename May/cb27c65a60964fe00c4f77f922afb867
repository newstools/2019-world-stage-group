WorldStage NewsOnline—-The FCT Directorate of Road Traffic Service (DRTS) on Monday reiterated its ban on the use of mini and medium capacity buses popularly known as ‘coaster’ from operating within the Territory. Mr Kayode Opeifa, Secretary, DRTS, in a statement on Monday in Abuja, said the ban was in accordance with the Federal Capital Territory Administration transportation master plan. The secretary, while addressing the management of the Secretariat, added that the reminder followed the number of such buses presently plying roads in the FCT. “These class of buses are not permitted to ply within the city center as most of these buses are rickety,” he said. Opeifa said that officers of the Vehicle Inspection Office (VIO) and men of DRTS had been ordered to expedite immediate enforcement of the ban. “Laws are made to be obeyed and for the FCTA in its wisdom to outlaw the use of mini and medium capacity buses in the city center, it has to be respected. “The recent meetings with the leadership of the Bus Drivers’ Association and other relevant unions are enough sensitisation,” he said. The secretary urged the DRTS to work closely with other relevant security agencies to ensure proper enforcement of the ban. He noted that the FCTA banned the use of mini buses popularly called ‘Araba’ 10 years ago.
