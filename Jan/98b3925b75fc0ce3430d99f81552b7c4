The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN)  has predicted a better future for the Nigerian economy if the Federal Government could sustain its investment in energy and transportation sectors. MAN’s President, Mr Ahmed Mansur, gave the assurance in an interview in Lagos on Thursday. The MAN’s president urged the Federal Government to invest more in energy supplies and transportation network to improve the business environment. Mansur said government’s zeal on infrastructure development was sacrosanct to spur more productive capacity. “Although the government is doing a lot in scaling up electricity provision, however, more is needed to ensure that manufacturers could cut-down cost. “The government should expedite the railway and roads being done, in order for domestic producers to reduce the time to convey their goods,’’ Mansur said.
