As part of efforts to improve the quality of teachers in schools, the Kaduna State Government has conducted an aptitude test to screen more than 62,000 applicants for 7,600 teaching jobs in the state’s public secondary school. The state’s Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Ja’afaru Sani, stated this after monitoring the exercise in a number of schools in Kaduna metropolis. Sani, who was accompanied by the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mrs Kande Bage, explained that about 31,000 HND, B.sc, Master’s Degree and Ph.D. holders were participating in the first phase of the screening exercise. He added that the more than 31,000 holders of Nigeria Certificate of Education (NCE) would write their examination in a later date. According to him, the measure is to ensure effective supervision with a view to getting the best to teach in secondary schools. ”You will recall that about two months ago, we placed advertisement seeking for qualified candidates to apply for teaching positions in our secondary schools. ”Today in this centre and many other centres across the state, the applicants were writing the aptitude test to be considered for the teaching positions. ”We had to do the screening in phases because we earlier envisaged a manageable number but ended up with more than 60,000 applicants seeking to join the teaching service of the state government. ”Because of logistics and the need to have a conducive environment for the examination, we decided to stager the screening exercise, starting with over 30,000 HND, B.Ed., B.sc, Masters and Ph.D holders. ”The over 31,000 NCE holders will be invited for the examination at no distant time,” he said.
