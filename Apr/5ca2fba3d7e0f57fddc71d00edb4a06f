As part of its effort in addressing the neglect and stigmatization of children living with Autism face, daily, GTBank has created a short film “A MOTHER KNOWS” to raise awareness about Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in Nigeria. The film tells the story of a young boy growing up with
autism and the impact of the condition on his family as they raise him. According to the WHO, 1 in 160 children live with Autism
Spectrum Disorders (ASD) worldwide. In Nigeria, however, the condition is
hardly diagnosed, rarely understood and children with ASD often suffer neglect
and stigmatization. To address these challenges, GTBank launched the Orange
Ribbon Initiative to support children and adults living with Autism and other
developmental disorders. The film, “The mother knows” was designed to help Speak up
against the stigmatisation of people living with Autism and other developmental
disorders.
