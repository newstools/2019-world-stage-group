Prof.  Yemi Osinbajo, Vice President  has called on the people of Kogi to come out en masse to vote for Gov. Yahaya Bello of All Progressives Congress (APC) on Nov. 16 election in the state in order to advance to the Next Level. Osinbajo’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, in a statement, said the vice president represented President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday at the inauguration of the APC governorship campaign in Idah, Kogi State. “I am not here on my own instructions alone; I bring you warm greetings from President Buhari. “It is a very short message that I have also brought from him. “You have heard our chairman who has said that Kogi is for the Next Level; we have finished the preliminary; it is now time to go to the Next Level,” he said. He urged them to move in their numbers to their respective polling units and vote for the party, branding the Nov. 16 Election Day as the `Next Level day’. Osinbajo said it was time for Kogi to join other APC controlled states in adopting the Next Level agenda. According to him, the only way to make sure that the state gets to the Next Level is by making sure everybody comes out to vote for Gov. Bello on Nov. 16. “So, I want to say to you, that all of us will hear very good news on Nov. 16. “I pray for you also that all of you will hear good news; your family will hear good news; Kogi will hear good news,” he said.
