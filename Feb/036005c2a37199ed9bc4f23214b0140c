As Nigerians prepare for the resheduled elections, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has urged Nigerians at home and in Diaspora to pray from Feb. 19 to Feb. 24 for the success of the polls.
The President of CAN, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, called for the prayers in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media and Communications, Mr Adebayo Oladeji, on Tuesday in Abuja.
Ayokunle said that the prayer was necessitated by the postponement of the Presidential and National Assembly elections to Feb. 23 by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
“The excuse INEC gave does not go down well with all stakeholders.
“The unfolding scenario on the political scene is not ordinary and there is a need for the Church to intercede for Nigeria.
“I want you to pray very well this week against some evil forces that are plotting against the election.
“If it’s about the things we see in the spirit, I am not sure that elections will hold at all. We should rise up and ask for transparent, free, fair and credible election that will even be better than those of 2015.
“That is why we have asked you to pray this week. This is a week for prayers. Pray that bad people will not be involved in Nigeria’s affairs.
“About the elections, we will pray that they will not result in war, bring hardship and suffering unto the populace,” he said.
The cleric prayed that God would take power from people who intend to cause problems for the nation and bind them.
According to him, it is our prayers that this will be the last time INEC will toy with any postponement again.
“It is reprehensible, unacceptable, condemnable, ungodly and a national embarrassment, and never again will Nigeria be subjected to this kind of rude shock of international proportion,’’ he said.
