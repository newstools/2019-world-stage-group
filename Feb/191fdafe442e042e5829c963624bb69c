President Muhammadu Buhari  has urged Nigerians to play their part within the confines of the law during the forthcoming general election, with that the outcome in God’s hands. Buhari stated this on Thursday in Makurdi at the 15th Biennial Conference of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN). Buhari,  who was represented by  the Vice President Yemi Osibanjo,  urged the Church to continue to stand for righteousness and truth, and preach against all forms of corruption. He said it was important for the Church to always stand on the side of righteousness and truth, as ”it is only righteousness that can elevate our country.” He lamented the recurring crises in Benue since 2011, and called on herders and farmers to sheath their swords and live in peace. ”It happens without exceptions. In fact without exceptions. But with your prayers there is peace and your meeting here is in peace. With your prayers it has been put under control. ”If it were before now your families would have discouraged you from visiting Benue because of the clashes. God will make Benue a point of contact to all nations,” the president said.
