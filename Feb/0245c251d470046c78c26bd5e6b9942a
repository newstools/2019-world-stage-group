President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his administration’s determination to ensure that every agency of government account for public revenue generated or expended, with some still in the habit of diverting or refusing to fully account for revenue generated. The President stated this on Monday at the sworn-in ceremony of the Chairman and Members of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission Board in Abuja. Buhari noted that despite his administration anti-corruption drive, some agencies of government were of the habit of diverting or refusing to fully account for revenue generated. According to him, rather than obey constitutional provisions and extant rules and regulations, such agencies continue as if nothing has changed. The president, therefore, called for ICPC’s support both for enforcement of anti-corruption laws and submission of policy measures and directives to prevent revenue leakage and diversion. “We are determined to ensure that every agency of government account for public revenue generated or expended. “I am looking forward to ICPC’s support both for enforcement of anti-corruption laws and submission of policy measures and directives to prevent revenue leakage and diversion. “In this regard, I urge you to collaborate with other government agencies such as the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation towards mitigating wrong-doing in public expenditure,’’ he added. President Buhari said he looked forward to receiving anti-corruption recommendations linked to e-Government standards and principles, saying “as the old saying goes – “Prevention is better than cure”. He also challenged the commission to come up with strong preventive policy measures and strategies for government’s endorsement “to take us to the NEXT LEVEL in the fight against corruption’’.
