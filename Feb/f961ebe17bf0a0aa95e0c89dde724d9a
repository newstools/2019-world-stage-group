Atiku Abubakar, Presidential Candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has expressed disappointment over the the postponement of the general elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The commission had shifted the Presidential and National Assembly elections from Feb.16 to Feb.23, and moved the Governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections from March 2 to March 9. Abubakar, who spoke to newsmen at his residence in Yola on Saturday, said he was shocked by the development, adding that it was not the best of decision to shift an election few hours to voting time. “I received the news with shock; you don’t postpone an election few hours to its commencement,” Atiku said. He urged Nigerians to be patient and endeavour to come out and vote on the new dates of the polls. “I urge Nigerians to be patient and come out en masse to vote,” he said.
