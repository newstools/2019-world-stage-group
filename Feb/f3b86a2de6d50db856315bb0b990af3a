WorldStage NewsOnline—-Following the rejection of the results of last Saturday’s elections  in Bayelsa State by the state Governor,  Seriake Dickson, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state has urged the governor to seek redress in court rather than making reckless statement about the outcome of the elections. The party described as baseless and misguided a statement credited to  Dickson rejecting results of Saturday’s elections in the state. APC said that Dickson sought to discredit votes scored in the state by President Muhammadu Buhari and its other candidates during the last Presidential and National Assembly Elections. The party made its position known in a statement on Thursday in Yenagoa by its State Publicity Secretary, Mr. Doifie Buokoribo. It advised Dickson to explore the democratic option of seeking redress in the courts, if he had any grievance about the poll results, instead of resorting to reckless and enflaming statements. “The attention of APC, Bayelsa State Chapter, has been drawn to a recent public statement by the Government of Bayelsa State. “In the statement, the Bayelsa government is reported to have rejected votes won by our party in the Presidential and National Assembly Elections. “Our state condemns the purported result from constituency 4 of Southern Ijaw and the seven Nembe wards. “We want the world and INEC to know that what happened in Nembe Bassambiri and Southern Ijaw Constituency 4 was a blatant assault on the rights of our people. “Bayelsa State is not Dickson. Bayelsa State is not a party to the general elections. Bayelsa State Government must not be confused with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “Governor Dickson seems not to realise that he is governor of all, not just PDP. Or are we to assume that APC members in Bayelsa State are from Sudan?’’ the APC stated.
