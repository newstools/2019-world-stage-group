As part of measures to promote acceptable values among the children, the Plateau Government has introduced a dress code for teachers in its primary schools. The state has also flagged off the planting of trees in its schools to serve as perimeter fences and ward off encroachment on school lands. Prof. Mathew Sule, who flagged off the two campaigns on Friday in Vom, near Jos, said that a dress code for the teachers had become necessary because they were mentors expected to be role models to the pupils. Sule, Executive Chairman, Plateau State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), said that teachers were critical stakeholders in the moulding of children to become responsible adults. “Many problems bedevil the society because of lack of proper conduct of teachers who are supposed to be role models of these children; this initiative is to address the abnormally. “We want effective mentoring by teachers; the first step in this direction is the dress code because that is the first thing the children see on the teacher,” he said. The SUBEB boss also regretted the massive land encroachment in public primary schools, saying that the trend was more prevalent in the northern senatorial district. “We are optimistic that the tree planting campaign will address the menace. The trees will serve as perimeter fences to prevent encroachment and also emit oxygen for the children,” he said. In his remarks, Gov Simon Lalong urged all teachers to comply with the code, pointing out that children at the basic education level needed such good morals to grow into responsible adults.
