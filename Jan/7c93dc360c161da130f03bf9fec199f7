As part of efforts to guarantee the health and safety of consumers in the state, the Lagos State Government says it will enforce standards in the sales and consumption of fruits and vegetables. Mr Divine Dunkwu, the Head, Public Affairs, State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA), made the assertion on Saturday in Lagos. Dunkwu said the agency had initiated a project to ensure that handling, packaging and display of vegetables and fruits were done in accordance with the acceptable standards. He said that LASCOPA was collaborating with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Lagos State Market Board and the Ministry of Wealth Creation, to drive the project to success. The agency’s spokesman said that the team was charged with the mandate to address the current unhygienic environment. According to him,  LASCOPA will look into the packaging, handling, ripening of fruits with unhealthy substances, lack of proper storage facilities and unhygienic environments for sales and display of the products.
