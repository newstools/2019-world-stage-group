Former Commissioner for New Cities Development in Cross River, Dr George Abang-Ekpungu narrowly escaped attacks by gunmen suspected to be hired killers on Sunday night. Abang-Ekpungu, who spoke to NAN on Monday in Calabar, said the incident took place in his country home in Kakwagom community in Boki local government area. “My house was attacked last night. The thugs came in with guns, machetes and other dangerous weapons to my house to kill me. “There was so much gunshots inside my house. My car and other valuables were destroyed and we found over 15 pellets in the morning. “I don’t know where this is coming from. I thank God for the safety of my wife and children. “I want to call on the state Commissioner of Police and other security agencies to move in immediately and investigate this matter because it has been reported,” he said. He told NAN that he has not had any political rivalry with anyone or quarrel that should warrant such an attack in his home. The State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, confirmed the attack. “The matter has been reported to police station in Boki. It was a malicious damage. There was no injury or loss of lives,” she said.
