WorldStage Newsonline– Not minding the recent ban placed on Catholic priest by the church to stop issuing political prophecies and statement, embattled Catholic Reverend Father and founder of Adoration Ministry, Enugu Ejike Mbaka has called on Nigerians to support  President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election in 2019. Mbaka had on Tuesday during his New Year prophetic message and crossover service stated that the type of difficulty the country was going to face was such that has not been “witnessed in its 58 years history. He therefore implored the citizens to pray hard to overcome what he tagged “impending unimaginable difficulty” in 2019. The call by Rev. Fr. Mbaka for President Buhari’s support was coming few weeks after the Catholic Bishops in the country barred Catholic priests and religious leaders of the catholic faith from endorsing any candidate for the forthcoming general elections. He also urged Nigerians to pray for the country and its leaders, adding Nigerians should support President Muhammad Buhari to continue his fight against corruption. The clergyman insisted that the Catholic Church supports the fight against corruption and that was why it created “prayers against bribery and corruption.” “A President that is fighting corruption needs to be supported,” he said. It could be recalled that in a recent statement signed by Most Reverend Augustine Akabueze, President and Most Reverend Camillus Umoh, Secretary respectively of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), the Church declared that no priest or religious should publicly endorse politicians.
