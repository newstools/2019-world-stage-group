The equity market which climbed past a three-month high on Feb. 15 reversed growth, following last minute postponement of the general elections. INEC announced the shift of the Feb. 16 Presidential and National Assembly elections to Feb. 23. The Governorship and State House of Assembly as well as FCT area council elections have also been shifted from March 2 to March 9. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, at a news conference attributed the postponement of elections to logistics and operational problems. Mr Sola Oni, a chartered stockbroker and Chief Executive Officer, Sofunix Investment and Communications, Lagos, said: “The sudden postponement, few hours to election period, was a sad commentary. “It has deepened Nigeria’s political risk with dire consequences on investment decision,” Oni said. He said that the shock caused by the announcement might jolt foreign portfolio investors who had been apprehensive of the presidential election. “It is not unlikely that trading on the stock may be moderated by this development as it is capable of further eroding investor confidence in our market. “Every political decision has direct or indirect impact on the financial market,“he stated. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd, had earlier said that the postponement, few minutes to the Election Day would further slow down economic activities. According to the expert, it will also cause cautious trading in the nation’s bourse. Omordion said that investors’ confidence on the recent stock market rebound would be dampened with the development. He said that the development had heightened uncertainty in the market arena and economy. Omordion said that investors who had started to pick up shares to position for a post-election rally were now dumping their shares due to INEC’s sudden decision to shift the polls.
