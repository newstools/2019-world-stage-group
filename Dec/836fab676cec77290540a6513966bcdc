WorldStage Newsonline– The Nigeria’s Senate has made a case for adequate  funding  for the  Navy, saying it has a deficit of 150 patrol vessels needed to checkmate insecurity  in the nation’s territorial  water   . This is coming as the Senate  halted the attempt to suspend operations  of Messrs OMLS Limited and other security agencies at the Safe Anchorage Area of the Lagos ports from  providing security services at the natino’ns waters. Presenting the joint committees report, Senator George Sekibo, submitted that the Nigerian Navy should be properly funded to enable it procure needed vessels to clear the over 150 vessels deficit and carry out their constitutional responsibilities without over depending on Private Maritime Logistics Support Companies (PMLSC). Also Senator Adeola Olamilekan representing Lagos West, revealed that $10,500 was paid per day by the Nigeria  Maritime Administrative  and Safety  Agency (NIMASA) to hire patrol vessel  from a private marine company, Messrs OMLS Limited to assist the  Navy to secure the water ways.

Below are the General findings of the investigative report,1) “That the Nigerian Ports Act, 1954 had given the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) the responsibility of charting, designating, owning, operating and managing anchorage areas but was silent on the provision or establishment of the Secured Anchorage Area (SAA);

10) That OMSL patrol boats in the SAA are operating under the command and control of the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Western Naval Command in accordance with the provision of extent MoU between the company and the Nigerian Navy; 11) That the existence and operation of the SAA cannot in any way be a threat to national security as it is being operated and supervised by the Nigerian Navy and not by OMSL directly; 12) That the allegation that the SAA pose a security threat to the Country is an indirect indictment on the Nigerian Navy as it’s the one operating on the platforms with the logistics provided by OMSL; 13) That the Nigerian Navy had on different occasions emphasized that its interest is for an enhanced and advanced maritime security to all users of the sea and as such wants to maintain neutrality; 14) That the neutrality of the Nigerian Navy is difficult to ascertain due to the fact that it operates on the platforms and logistics provided by OMSL at the Secured Anchorage Area (SAA);

30) That the major factor that prompted the decision of NPA to request for the stoppage of the SAA is for the need to reduce the cost incurred by vessels owners when calling to Nigerian Ports and the need to promote ease of doing business in the country; 31) That in matters relating to port cost, the Nigeria Shippers Council (NSC) takes the lead as the Economic Regulator of the ports as it’s the one with such responsibility and as such, NPA cannot act unilaterally;

37) That it will be difficult to convince a domain expert in the maritime industry that the fees charges at the SAA facility could increase port cost; 38) That the provision of the SAA comes to Government at no cost; 39) That the provision of an alternative to the SAA will require a huge budgetary allocation from the Government; 40) That no alternative provision is in place that will provide the needed security for vessels waiting to berth at Lagos ports like the current Secured Anchorage Area (SAA) operated by OMSL; 41) That in the past six (6) years of rendering the services of the SAA, all pirate attacks in the SAA have been repealed thus given the service a 100% success level; 42) That the SAA facility has indeed restored the confidence of the Nigerian merchant and shippers in the use of Lagos ports; 43) That the SAA facility does not cost the Government anything but rather helped to reduce Government expenditure in providing security at the nation’s waters; 44) That there is the need for Government Agencies to understand their schedule of duty and responsibility as well as the areas of their jurisdiction to avoid possible overlap of function; and 45) That there is no genuine intention in the argument being canvassed by those seeking for the dismantling of the SAA facility due to the fact that no alternative arrangement has been put in place. Recommendations  of the committe  are:”That the Nigerian Navy, the Nigerian Ports Authority and NIMASA, should be commended for initiating and implementing a process that led to the provision of enhanced and advanced maritime security in the Secured Anchorage Area (SAA) in the Lagos waters in 2013 that has led in checkmating the high rate of attacks on vessels waiting to berth at the Lagos ports; “That Ocean Marine Solution Limited (OMSL) should be commended for its genuine national interests in investing over Four Hundred Million ($400,000,000) Dollars into the Security at the Secured Anchorage Area (SAA) in particular and the Nigerian waterways in general by providing the needed platforms and logistics for the Nigerian Navy to effectively perform 24/7/365 patrol operations as well as to provide the required protection for vessels waiting to berth at the Lagos ports; “That since no fraud is found in the operations of the OMSL and is operating at no cost to government, OMSL should be allowed to continue its operation at the SAA until such a time when a better and more cost effective system is put in place by the government. “That the Nigerian Navy should be properly funded to enable it procure needed vessels to clear the over one hundred and fifty (150) vessels deficit to enable them carry out their constitutional responsibilities without over depending on Private Maritime Logistics Support Companies (PMLSC)”.
