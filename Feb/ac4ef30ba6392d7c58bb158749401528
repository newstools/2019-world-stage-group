A director in the National Emergence Management Agency (NEMA), Emenike Umesi, was  on Wednesday docked before an FCT High Court, Maitama over alleged misappropriation of N54.3 million.
Umesi is being tried by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on four-count bordering on misappropriation of public funds.
Justice Jude Okeke granted Umesi bail in the sum of N50 million and a surety in like sum.
Okeke said the surety must be a resident of the FCT and must own a landed property in Abuja.
Okeke ordered that the surety should deposit his street address and land title documents to the court and shall in addition show evidence of tax payment over the last three years.
He said he granted bail to the defendant because the prosecution had not objected to the bail application neither had the defendant defaulted in the administrative bail granted him by the EFCC.
He adjourned the case until April 15 for commencement of trial.
Earlier, the EFCC had alleged that on Dec. 30, 2014, Umesi serving as the Acting Director, Special Duty in NEMA allegedly misappropriated N12.8 million meant for the Agency ‘s operations .
