Osun State Governor, Mr. Gboyega Oyetola has called on Nigerian youths   to shun vote-buying and selling during the general elections. Oyetola made the appeal while playing host to a socio-political youth organisation, “Oyetola Connect Group’’ on Saturday in Osogbo. According to the governor, recent statistics reveals that 51 per cent of Nigerian voting population are youths. The governor said it was high time Nigerian youths made use of their numerical strength with a view to entrenching democracy, visionary leadership and good governance in the country. He urged them to be law-abiding during the elections and shun vote-buying and selling, saying that such acts were capable of undermining the integrity of the electoral process. Oyetola also appealed to the group to work toward the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari and all other APC candidates in the state during the general elections. While commending the group for their support of his administration, the governor urged them to participate actively during the elections.
