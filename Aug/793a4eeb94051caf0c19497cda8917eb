The group, said: “We wish to bring to the attention of the state and nation, the situation we found ourselves in the last three months”. “From May 29, to July 2019, over 57 people have been killed by bandits in our villages and towns in Birnin Gwari Local Government. “We can also confirm that over 145 people have on several occasions been kidnapped within the same time. “The situation in Birnin Gwari is getting worse as our people can neither go to their farms nor even travel out of the local government area. “We are suffering and dying everyday.” “The bandits in our local government area are extorting money from our people and burning down villages that refused to cooperate with them”, they lamented. “We are becoming helpless. “The security men sent to us are only visible in two villages and nowhere to be seen. The bandits kill and rape our women on a daily basis,” they said. “We massively voted for the APC and particularly, Uba Sani, who promised to visit us regularly and help our Internally Displaced Persons and security groups”.
