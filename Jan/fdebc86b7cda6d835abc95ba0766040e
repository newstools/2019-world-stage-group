Dr Dakuku Peterside, Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) on Monday in Lagos appealed to Nigerian law officers for quick resolution of maritime cases. He made the appeal at the ongoing 8th Strategic Admiralty Law Seminar for Judges with the theme: `Strengthening Nigeria’s Admiralty Regime through Effective Implementation of International Maritime and Labour Instrument’’. The seminar was organised by NIMASA alongside the Nigeria Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (NIALS). Peterside said that the protracted maritime and shipping disputes in the judicial system was scaring foreign investors away from the country. He said one million jobs could be created within a short period in the sector if public confidence was boosted through a good and judicial system. “As a maritime administrator, I have spoken to several people in other countries on coming to invest in Nigeria, who expressed disgust at our judicial system. “Shipping and maritime disputes are business cases that has people’s capital attached to it. Such issues should be given quick response,’’ Peterside said. Prof. Adedeji Adekunle, Director-General of NIALS, who was represented by Prof. Emmaunel Okon, Director of Studies, NIALS, said one of the objectives of the event was to fine-tune legal administration concerning maritime. Adekunle said that the bench would partner with NIMASA to foster quick dispute resolution in order to grow the sector.
