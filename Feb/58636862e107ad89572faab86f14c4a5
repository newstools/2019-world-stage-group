WorldStage NewsOnline—-The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara has promised that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would address the decades of scarcity of potable water and decayed infrastructure being experienced by people in the state. Alhaji Tajudeen Mustapha-Asunnara, the state Coordinator for Buhari Support Group (BSG), made the promise at a news conference on Thursday in llorin. The news conference was organised by the party’s stalwarts to express the party’s gratitude to the people of the state for their votes for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari polled over 308, 984 to defeat his closest rival, Atiku Abubakar, of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who polled 138, 184 in the last  Presidential and National Assembly elections in the state. Mustapha-Asunnara described acute water scarcity being experienced by the state residents, especially in llorin metropolis, as pathetic. “I wonder why the water project embarked upon by the successive administrations in the state failed to address the problem in several parts of llorin Metropolis,’’ he said. Mustapha-Asunnara, however, assured the people of the party’s determination to tackle the problem headlong. He promised that Buhari-led administration would embark on more infrastructure facilities aimed at making life more meaningful to the people of the state.
