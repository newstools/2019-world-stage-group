WorldStage Newsonline– The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied a newspaper report that it had raised teams to quiz Amosun, Okocha, Yari, all outgoing governors, as immunity ends. The newspapers had claimed that ahead of May 29,
2019, handover date to newly elected states helmsmen, the Commission had set up
teams to probe some governors accused of perpetuating acts of corruption. “It is instructive to note that the reporter did not
give the composition and terms of reference of the purported teams set up by
the EFCC,” the aganecy said in a statement. “The report is a figment of the imagination of the
reporter as everything about the setting of the teams ended with the first
paragraph without details of such teams being set up. “Again, the story is not true, as the EFCC does not
go after anybody, including ex-governors on speculative ground. “For the avoidance of doubt, the Commission only act
after the investigators have done a thorough job on any individual or firm
involved in corruption related cases. “The Commission wants to advise our stakeholders,
including our friends in the media to be circumspect and verify their stories
before going to press.

“Members
of the public are therefore advise to disregard the story as no team has been
set up against any former governor.”
